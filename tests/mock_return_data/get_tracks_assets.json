    "detail_copy": "<p>Nestled at the foot of the Berkshire Mountains in the Northwest corner of Connecticut, Lime Rock Park is as picturesque for visitors as it is challenging for drivers. At a relatively short 1.53 miles in length, its layout is deceptively simple. Even professional drivers find it difficult to unlock the secret of a very fast lap.</p> <p>Racers sometimes refer to its seven corners - six right-handers and one left - as a road racing short-track due to the high average speed and the fact that there is no opportunity to relax during a lap.</p> <p>Opened on April 20, 1957, Lime Rock Park is the home track for the Skip Barber Racing School and is one of the oldest continuously-operated road courses in North America. The track has witnessed epic battles among some true legends of the sport. Drivers like Mark Donohue, Brian Redman, Hans Stuck, Paul Newman and Geoff Brabham have all battled their way to victory at Lime Rock Park.</p> <p>In addition to SCCA club races, Lime Rock Park hosts rounds of the American Le Mans Series on the 4th of July (on a second track layout that utilizes a chicane just after the daunting Uphill corner) and the Grand Am GT series over the Memorial Day weekend. The track also is host annually to the NASCAR Camping World East Series&#8482;.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Today's \"Modified\" traces its lineage back to the very beginning of stock car racing, decades before the advent of current-body style cars made their appearance on race tracks across America. And it was at Stafford Motor Speedway 20 years ago that the Modified Stock Car, seemingly on the road to oblivion, had a rebirth.</p> <p>Racing began at the Stafford Springs Agricultural Park in 1870, but the powerplants propelling the drivers were purely equine until the end of World War II, when Midgets, Sprint Cars and on occasion Stock Cars displaced the horses on the half-mile flat dirt track.</p> <p>In 1959 the management of Stafford Speedway obtained a NASCAR sanction, an arrangement that endures to this day. Track visitors from the south - Lee Petty, Joe Weatherly and Curtis Turner challenged their northern counterparts - Pete Corey, Ernie Gahan, Bill Wimble, Frankie Schneider and a youngster named Eddie Flemke.</p> <p>In 1967 the track was paved, with flat, sweeping turns that put a premium on driving skill. Bugs Stevens, Fred Desarro, Jerry Cook, and Richie Evans all won at Stafford on their way to NASCAR National Modified Championships.</p> <p>In 1969 the Arute family took over management of the facility and in short order made changes that brought Modified racing back from its slide toward extinction. The Arutes encouraged a change in bodywork that did away with the 1930s-era coupe and sedan coachwork and put shells from contemporary cars over the tube-frame chassis. This gave the cars a more modern, up-to-date appearance, one that fans in the grandstands could better identify with. And then, a few years later, the Arutes, alarmed at the accelerating costs of racing, drew up a set of technical rules for something they called the SK Modified. The rules retained the chassis and bodywork of the standard Modified, but reduced the costs for tires and engines, the most expensive aspects of racing.</p> <p>Today, nearly 130 years after racers first competed there, Stafford Speedway is still on the cutting edge of progress. In 1997, a 270,000-watt state-of-the art MUSCO lighting system was installed. And Bose selected Stafford as a research and design facility and maintains an 8,400-watt sound system, so spectators can easily hear the announcer over the roar of the engines.</p>",

OPS opened in 1950 as a half-mile dirt track with shallow-banked turns. Carved out of 200 acres of woodland in six short weeks, the facility featured a wooden grandstand that seated 5,000 spectators and parking for 1,000 cars.</p> <p>In 1961 the track was revamped as a one-third-mile paved oval with wide-open turns. Three years later Maine businessman Bob Bahre purchased the track and began a program of improvements to the facility that included a modern large-capacity grandstand. With the widening of the backstretch during a 1992 repaving, the track assumed its current 3/8ths-mile configuration.</p> <p>During the 1960s Oxford Plains Speedway hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; races, and in 1966 Bobby Allison won his first victory on NASCAR's senior circuit at OPS. Today Late Models are the featured class and the track is home to the annual TD Banknorth 250, the richest one-day Late Model race meet in America. In 2007 156 cars entered the event, with 92 of them taking part in time trials. Over the years Allison's son Davey, Jeff and Ward Burton, Kurt and Kyle Busch, Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Matt Kenseth, Bobby and Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, and Rusty Wallace are among the NASCAR stars who have competed in this historic Late-Model event.</p>",

From 1950 through 1953 the town had been host to annual sports car races conducted on ad-hoc circuits made up of linked sections of county highways, but safety concerns ended open-road racing. The track was built by local civil engineer Cliff Tufte, who set out a 14-turn, four-mile ribbon of pavement, literally over hill and dale. Tufte took advantage of the hillsides adjacent to many parts of the track to provide natural viewing areas for spectators.</p> <p>Road America, one of the world's classic road-racing venues, has been host to every important North American racing series, beginning with SCCA sports cars in the 1950s, to the Can-Am and Trans-Am in the '60s and '70s, IMSA's GT and GTP cars since the '70s, and Indy cars beginning in 1982. NASCAR even ran a race at Road America, back in 1956, won by the legendary Tim Flock. The June Sprints, put on annually for more than 50 years by the SCCA's Chicago Region, draws 600  amateur sports car racers and as many as 30,000 spectators. The current schedule also includes vintage and motorcycle racing.</p> <p>One of the unique aspects of Road America is that it is beloved both by spectators, who are afforded a variety of spectacular views and by drivers, who value the challenges the track presents. And while Road America enjoys a rich tradition, it is not a prisoner of its history. A recent upgrade to the facility saw spectator viewing and paddock access improved by the replacement of the Bill Mitchell bridge with a tunnel a hundred yards further down the road. A further nod to the performance gains wrought by modern technology is the addition of an optional chicane at Road America's famous \"kink\" in the back straightaway, providing a second configuration for race series that don't wish to expose their drivers to one of motorsport's biggest thrills every four miles.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>The old saying, \"it's an ill wind that blows no good,\" could be appropriately applied to Homestead-Miami Speedway. In the wake of Hurricane Andrew in August, 1992, South Florida racing promoter Ralph Sanchez began organizing construction of the region's first major-league motorsports facility as part of the reconstruction of the devastated Homestead community. Ground-breaking took place the following August and on Aug. 24, 1993, the first event, a NASCAR Xfinity Series race, was won by Dale Jarrett.</p> <p>Longtime host to NASCARs season finale for the top three series, the 1.5-mile variable-banked Homestead-Miami oval has also hosted Indycar and IMSA events. SCCA amateur races and CSS motorcycle races also take place on the road circuit.</p> <p>With more than a thousand palm trees and a Caribbean color scheme, the facility projects a South Beach flavor that distinguishes Homestead-Miami from other major race tracks in America. It took a while longer to get the right combination for the racing surface. In its first iteration, the track had four separate low-banked corners - that configuration failed to promote good racing, and unfortunately also provided bad crash angles. Widening the aprons failed to correct either of these problems.</p> <p>A major reconfiguration of the track during the summer of 1997 brought a more conventional layout - sweeping 180-degree corners at either end of the oval. Close, but still no cigar. But the most recent work on the track, during which the track assumed variable banking - up to 20 degrees in the corners, flattening to 3 degrees on the straightaways - has done the trick. Everyone agrees, at Homestead-Miami, the beauty is now more than skin deep.</p>",

Even professional drivers find it difficult to unlock the secret of a very fast lap.</p> <p>Racers sometimes refer to its seven corners - six right-handers and one left - as a road racing short-track due to the high average speed and the fact that there is no opportunity to relax during a lap.</p> <p>Opened on April 20, 1957, Lime Rock Park is the home track for the Skip Barber Racing School and is one of the oldest continuously-operated road courses in North America. The track has witnessed epic battles among some true legends of the sport. Drivers like Mark Donohue, Brian Redman, Hans Stuck, Paul Newman and Geoff Brabham have all battled their way to victory at Lime Rock Park.</p> <p>In addition to SCCA club races, Lime Rock Park hosts rounds of the American Le Mans Series on the 4th of July (on a second track layout that utilizes a chicane just after the daunting Uphill corner) and the Grand Am GT series over the Memorial Day weekend. The track also is host annually to the NASCAR Camping World East Series&#8482;.</p>",

Built by local dairy magnate George Barber adjacent to his world-class motorsports museum, Barber Motorsports Park includes a total of three track configurations. The track opened in 2003 and in addition to motorcycle races, is host to the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482;, SCCA club racing weekends and vintage and historic events. Located in a heavily wooded area near Birmingham, Alabama, the Alan Wilson-designed 2.3-mile, 16-turn, sinuous circuit is the epitome of the modern dedicated road-racing facility.</p> <p>Like other Wilson-designed circuits, each of the three track configurations requires a very technical driving style to achieve a good lap time. All of the racing surface is a generous 45 feet wide, which helps provide good passing opportunities, while the 80 feet of total elevation change adds to a driver's challenge and enjoyment by providing blind apexes to a couple of the turns. </p> <p>The beauty of Barber Motorsports Park doesn't end at the edge of the pavement; whimsical large-scale sculptures grace the beautifully landscaped facility, ranging from a pride of lions, Sisyphus pushing a large boulder, ants, birds and dragonflies to the track's hallmark, a giant steel spider outside Turn 5.</p> <p>Directly adjacent to the circuit is the Barber Vintage Motorsport Museum, where you can almost make out the cars and motorcycles inside.</p>",

From 1950 through 1953 the town had been host to annual sports car races conducted on ad-hoc circuits made up of linked sections of county highways, but safety concerns ended open-road racing. The track was built by local civil engineer Cliff Tufte, who set out a 14-turn, four-mile ribbon of pavement, literally over hill and dale. Tufte took advantage of the hillsides adjacent to many parts of the track to provide natural viewing areas for spectators.</p> <p>Road America, one of the world's classic road-racing venues, has been host to every important North American racing series, beginning with SCCA sports cars in the 1950s, to the Can-Am and Trans-Am in the '60s and '70s, IMSA's GT and GTP cars since the '70s, and Indy cars beginning in 1982. NASCAR even ran a race at Road America, back in 1956, won by the legendary Tim Flock. The June Sprints, put on annually for more than 50 years by the SCCA's Chicago Region, draws 600  amateur sports car racers and as many as 30,000 spectators. The current schedule also includes vintage and motorcycle racing.</p> <p>One of the unique aspects of Road America is that it is beloved both by spectators, who are afforded a variety of spectacular views and by drivers, who value the challenges the track presents. And while Road America enjoys a rich tradition, it is not a prisoner of its history. A recent upgrade to the facility saw spectator viewing and paddock access improved by the replacement of the Bill Mitchell bridge with a tunnel a hundred yards further down the road. A further nod to the performance gains wrought by modern technology is the addition of an optional chicane at Road America's famous \"kink\" in the back straightaway, providing a second configuration for race series that don't wish to expose their drivers to one of motorsport's biggest thrills every four miles.</p>",

The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p> <p>With 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p> <p>Opened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth. The track hosts events for all three of NASCAR\u2019s national series and the ARCA Menards Series, has gone through dirt makeovers to welcome World of Outlaws events as well as the Cup Series\u2019 only dirt race multiple times in its history.</p>",

A state-of-the-art motorsport facility, its nickname, \"the Diamond in the Desert\", is well deserved. Las Vegas Motor Speedway has the polished brilliance that is a trademark of Speedway Motorsports' properties, and it is truly multifaceted.</p> <p>Originally constructed in 1996, Las Vegas Motor Speedway held its first major event in September of that year, an IRL race won by Richie Hearn. The first NASCAR event, a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race, followed two months later. The NASCAR Xfinity Series paid a visit in 1997, before the NASCAR Cup Series arrived in 1998, marking the beginning of the track's long-term success. Changes to the oval in 2006 made it a more competitive venue for stock cars. This major renovation revamped the banking, upping if from a modest 12 degrees to 20. Not only that, but the corners were banked progressively, meaning the further up the racing surface, the steeper the banking. Lap speeds jumped and racing got more competitive. The current stock car track record, held by Kasey Kahne, is just under 185 mph.</p> <p>Although the oval gets much of the prime-time attention these days, the facility's multiple infield configurations make the desert speed palace a great venue for road racing, karting and Legends Car racing. There are three different road courses, two that are confined to the infield and one that makes use of the big oval. The infield circuits are small but challenging and provide a good opportunity to test set-up packages. In addition, there are two short ovals, one pit-lane based and one in the infield, on which Legends Cars regularly compete.</p>",

Though originally built for open wheel racing, over the past two decades the desert flower has become even more famous for stock car competition.</p> <p>With its short front straight and asymmetrical layout - including a trademark left-hand dog leg on the backstretch -- this demanding one mile circuit has been a favorite with top driving talent since it opened in 1964. That fall Mario Andretti got his big career break when he manhandled an old front engine Offy \"roadster\" IndyCar around the tricky track.</p> <p>Other legendary Indy shoes including A.J. Foyt, Parnelli Jones, numerous Unsers, Michael Andretti, Sam Hornish, Jr and Dario Franchitti all competed successfully at PIR, as did Dutchman Arie Luyendyk a two-time winner who holds the IndyCar lap record of 183 mph at PIR.</p> <p>NASCAR's top series first came to the Valley of the Sun in 1988, and though they lap nearly 50 mph slower, stock car drivers have found PIR every bit as challenging as their open wheel counterparts. The list of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series winners reads like a Who's Who of NASCAR, including Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon, the father and son Earnhardts, Bill Elliott, Tony Stewart, Mark Martin, Kurt and Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth. </p> <p>In addition to NASCAR's top tier, the NASCAR Nationwide Series, NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and K&N Pro Series West also compete at PIR and each year , USAC sanctions the Copper World Classic, a weekend festival of Silver Crown and Midget racing. The facility also includes a 13 turn, 1.51 mile (2.43 km) road course that utilizes most of the oval along with a twisting infield section that hosted Rolex GRAND-AM Road Racing Series events from 2000-06.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>\"The Lady in Black,\" \"The Track That's Too Tough To Tame\"; those are two of the names, the polite ones anyway, that drivers and fans have given Darlington Raceway over the years. The oldest speedway on the NASCAR circuit, Darlington Raceway's egg-shaped configuration - one end is big and wide-open while the other is pinched tight - has been perplexing racing drivers and mechanics since it opened in 1950 with the inaugural running of the Southern 500 NASCAR stock car race. The track was built on an old farm in the middle of rural South Carolina, and its unique shape is the legacy of a minnow pond that the farmer who owned the land wasn't willing to give up. Minnows still swim in that pond six decades later, and while lap speeds have risen to nearly 180 mph, a car set up just right for one end of the 1.366-mile oval still won't handle on the other one. The fastest lap times are achieved with a compromise - the car isn't perfect at either end of the track, but a really talented driver can coax the car quickly enough through both sets of corners.</p> <p>A look at the list of race winners over the years confirms that at Darlington talent tells. Few journeymen drivers have won at Darlington - through the years the winner's circle has mostly welcomed the sport's enduring stars. Those legendary drivers have dominated the competition, and at a track where it is so difficult to win even once, those who have unlocked Darlington's mysteries have been able to win again and again; of the 43 men who have won a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race there through 2008, more than half - 24 to be exact - have won at least twice. Richard Petty and Buck Baker have the three victories each to their credit; Bill Elliott and Harry Gant were four-time winners; Bobby Allison, Darrell Waltrip and Cale Yarborough have won five times; and in recent years, as the competition in NASCAR intensified, Jeff Gordon has found his way first under the checkered flag a remarkable seven times.</p> <p>When it comes to the true Darlington legends, however, two drivers stand apart from the rest. Dale Earnhardt, Sr. won nine times. \"You never forget your first love,\" Earnhardt was quoted as saying. \"Whether it's a high school sweetheart, a faithful old hunting dog, or a fickle race track in South Carolina with a contrary disposition. And, if you happen to be a race car driver there's no victory so sweet, so memorable, as whipping Darlington Raceway.\"</p> <p>But the most successful driver of all time at what is perhaps the most difficult track on the NASCAR circuit is David Pearson, the '60s and '70s ace known as the Silver Fox for his smooth style behind the wheel. Ten times at Darlington Pearson outfoxed the other drivers and the track itself. If he'd won any more, they'd have had to turn over the deed to the track to him.</p>",

Constructed by the France family's International Speedway Corporation ten years after Daytona International Speedway, Talladega was built slightly longer at 2.66 miles and with steeper 33-degree banking which guaranteed record-setting speeds. The pole speed for NASCAR's first race in 1969 was a stunning 199.466 mph, almost 30 mph faster than the IndyCars were then lapping at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p> <p>In 1975 Mark Donohue set the world record for speed on a closed course by driving a Porsche 917-30 around Talladega Superspeedway at 221.160 mph. Donohue's world record stood for four years before finally being broken at Italy's 7.5-mile Nardo high-speed test facility.</p> <p>Rule changes in 1987 mean Bill Elliott's 212.809 mph lap will stand forever as the qualifying record at Talladega and for NASCAR. Talladega Superspeedway is still the fastest track on the schedule\u2014it holds the record for the fastest 500-mile stock car race at 188.354 mph, Mark Martin's winning speed in May 1997\u2014and produces some of the most exciting fender-to-fender racing every year.</p> <p>Talladega holds the record for most leaders in a 500-mile race (26) and most lead changes as well (75 at the start/finish line), but on the last lap, don't ever bet against a driver named Earnhardt. Dale Sr. racked up an amazing ten NASCAR Cup Series race wins, and Dale Jr. added six on his resume, including a remarkable four-in-a-row streak in 2002-3.</p> <p>Talladega Superspeedway presents five separate racing shows each year as host to NASCAR\u2019s top three series and one of the ARCA Menards Series\u2019 most prestigious events of the season. Competing in high-speed packs at Talladega should prove both challenging and exciting for iRacers as well.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>With the possible exception of New York City, no American market has been more coveted - or more underserved - by the auto racing industry than Chicago. After the Meadowdale International Raceway road course and its fearsome \"Monza Wall\" closed in 1968, sanctioning bodies from CART and IMSA to Formula One attempted to organize auto races in, around and through the Windy City with little success. Even Chip Ganassi's Midas touch failed when his Chicago Motor Speedway ceased operations in 2002 after just four years of staging CART and NASCAR races.</p> <p>Of course, one major factor contributing to the demise of CMS was the opening of a competing facility in nearby Joliet by the name of Chicagoland Speedway. Built at a cost of $130 million and backed by a virtual Who's Who of American auto racing, Chicagoland Speedway is a world class motor sports complex featuring a 1.5 mile superspeedway together with a state-of-the-art drag strip at the adjacent Route 66 Raceway. Who's Who? Try Tony George and the late Bill France, Jr., together with a collection of Chicago-area entrepreneurs including IndyCar Series team owner Dale Coyne.</p> <p>Although it's tempting to lump the 1.5 mile oval with the bevy of so-called \"intermediate\" ovals that rose across the country in the 1990s and early years of the 21st century, Chicagoland's layout is unique. It's an oval that never truly straightens out thanks to a couple of kinks on the frontstretch and a backstretch that is one long, continuous curve. As a result, Chicagoland poses unique challenges, not just to those who drive it but to the engineers and mechanics who must fine-tune their cars to the track's singular character.</p> <p>Since opening for business in 2001, Chicagoland has established a rich history in its first decade of operation, particularly in INDYCAR competition. In a series renowned for its photo finishes, the INDYCAR Series produced the two closest finishes in series history at Chicagoland, with Sam Hornish, Jr. beating Al Unser, Jr. by .0024s in 2002 and Helio Castroneves pipping Scott Dixon by .033s in the 2008 season finale. Of course, neither Dario Franchitti nor Scott Dixon will soon forget the 2007 contest that saw the Scotsman win the race - and the IndyCar Series title - when \"Dixie\" ran out of fuel half a lap from the finish.</p> <p>Chicagoland is no less competitive when the race cars sport fenders. In fact, Kyle Busch is the only driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race at Chicagoland from the pole. Ironically enough, however, Chicagoland\u2019s unique challenges and propensity for great racing weren\u2019t enough to save it from the NASCAR chopping block after 2019; in its place, NASCAR created its Chicago Street Race in 2023, although Chicagoland fans cite the revivals of tracks like North Wilkesboro, Nashville Superspeedway, and Rockingham as reason to have faith in a return for their beloved speedway someday as well.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Designed by Charles Moneypenny, the same architect who created Daytona International speedway, and located in the vacation-area Irish Hills of the south-central part of the state, Michigan International Speedway is best-known for the awesome speeds and competitive racing spawned by its broad racing surface and 73-foot-wide, 18-degree banked turns.  Michigan's width and steep banking ensure there's always more than one racing groove, and the fact that MIS is a non-restrictor-plate track means drivers have more than enough power to make a challenge out of the turns at both ends of the track.</p> <p>Once upon a time Indy cars frolicked on those high banks at breathtaking speeds, witness Paul Tracy's record qualifying lap of 234.949 mph.   Today, Michigan regularly vies with Daytona, Talladega and Texas as NASCAR's fastest speedway, with Ryan Newman holding the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; track record of 194.232 mph.   While MIS' Stirling Moss-designed 3.1-mile road course and the Can-Am and Trans-Am races of days gone-by are now just fond memories, the track has a 1.9-mile interior road course that has challenged IMSA and amateur racers down through the years.</p> <p>It's no wonder some of stock car racing's most legendary drivers have thrived on the banks of MIS since Cale Yarborough defeated Lee Roy Yarbrough in the inaugural NASCAR race there in 1969.  Richard Petty and David Pearson, Bobby and Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt Senior and Junior, Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson have all since added their names to the roll call of MIS winners, one that also includes names like Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Rick Mears and Alex Zanardi from the days when Indy cars raced in the Irish Hills, not to mention Parnelli Jones and Mark Donohue, Trans-Am winners on the MIS road course that, once upon a time, snaked through the countryside behind the backstretch.  Allison to Yarborough, Andretti to Zanardi, the world's greatest race drivers have been coming to Michigan International Speedway to test their mettle for more than 40 years.  And the fans have followed by the hundreds of thousands.\nDetroit-area real-estate developer Larry LoPatin had the vision to build first Michigan International Speedway and then a Southwestern duplicate, Texas World Speedway in College Station, TX.  But LoPatin's reach exceeded his grasp and it was a fellow named Roger Penske who stepped in and turned MIS into an auto-racing showcase.  Under Penske's direction, MIS grew from a rather modest seating capacity of 25,000 to more than 125,000 between 1972 and '99.  And the first order of business when the International Speedway Corporation acquired the facility from Penske?  Add another 10,000 seats in Turn Three, enhancing MIS' status as the largest sports facility in the Wolverine State.</p>",

The first superspeedway constructed in the United States in twenty years, NHMS heralded the start of a construction frenzy that would see more than a dozen new speedways built around the country by the close of the decade. Many of the new tracks would be faster, some more ostentatious, but none placed a premium on car and driver like NHMS.</p> <p>Just over a mile in length, NHMS' oval is a classic \"paper-clip\" design with long straightaways and tight, flat turns. Not surprisingly, the track rewards cars that have plenty of \"grunt\" off the corners and brakes capable of getting things slowed-down at the end of the front straightaway and the backstretch... not to mention drivers who can baby those brakes from start to finish in races lasting three hours or more while making their cars work high and low in the turns.</p> <p>Speaking of more, there's more to NHMS than the one mile oval. In keeping with a heritage dating back to 1965 when the site was home to twisty Bryar Motorsports Park, NHMS offers top-flight road racing. Although the configurations incorporate different portions of the oval and twisting infield roads, they all utilize a breathtaking loop that climbs into the countryside beyond the backstretch to a 180 degree bowl of a turn before plunging back down to the oval.</p> <p>With an oval hosting a full slate of NASCAR competition including NASCAR Cup Series, Craftsman Truck Series, and Whelen Modified Tour events, road courses that are home to a variety of SCCA and vintage sports car events, as well as motorcycle races and permanent seating for more than 105,000 spectators, it's no wonder NHMS is the undisputed home of motorsports in New England. Nor was it any wonder when founders Bob and Gary Bahre decided to sell the facility in 2008 that Bruton Smith and Speedway Motorsports Inc. were happy to make them an offer they couldn't refuse.</p>",

Situated in the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania , the 2.5 mile tri-oval features three very different turns connected by straightaways of varying length. Turn One is banked at 14 degrees, Turn Two (aka the \"Tunnel Turn\") is banked at eight degrees and Turn Three at six degrees. Pocono's main straightaway is the longest on any North American speedway at 3,740 feet, the \"Long Pond\" straightaway stretches for 3,055 feet between Turns One and Two, while the run from Turn Two to Turn Three is a mere 1,780 feet.</p> <p>The resulting speedway poses special demands on drivers and engineer alike, for a chassis that works well on the steeply-banked Turn One will be less than ideal for the flatter Turn Two, let alone Turn Three, and the downforce necessary for maximum grip in any of the turns will slow a car on the two long straightaways. And Turn Three requires heavy braking - in some cases even a gear change - making Pocono Raceway among the world's most challenging speedways.</p> <p>Pocono Raceway first opened for business in 1969 featuring a three quarter mile oval. The 2.5 mile speedway was completed in 1971 and immediately began hosting one of the jewels in Indy car racing triple crown of 500 mile races. Local hero Mario Andretti battled the likes of A.J. Foyt, Al and Bobby Unser, Johnny Rutherford and Gordon Johncock in , USAC-sanctioned Indy car races. NASCAR was also at Pocono from the early days, as witnessed by the fact that Richard Petty won NASCAR's inaugural Pocono 500 in 1974. Pocono also staged a number of top flight sports car races on its combination road course/oval layouts in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as various short track events on the original three-quarter mile oval encircling the main pit area.</p> <p>Located equa-distantly from New York City and Philadelphia - and with the rabid race fans of central Pennsylvania nearby - the track attracts overflow crowds for its two NASCAR weekends. Since Petty's win in 1974, the greatest names in stock car racing have visited Victory Lane at Pocono... not to mention Denny Hamlin who attributed much of his early success at Pocono to his sim-racing experience! Modern Pocono race weekends include all three of NASCAR\u2019s premier national series, as well as the ARCA Menards Series.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>A motorsports Lazarus, Virginia International Raceway is a race track that came back from the dead. Born in 1957 during the initial blitz of U.S. road-racing circuit development, VIR was one of the major sports car racing facilities during the 1960s. Cobra legend Carroll Shelby won the inaugural race behind the wheel of a Maserati 450 S, and over the years races at VIR produced fields populated by sports car stars Carl Haas, Bob Holbert, Augie Pabst, Bob Grossman, Don Yenko, Dick Thompson, Walt Hansgen and Bruce Jennings and NASCAR legends such as Richard Petty, David Pearson, Curtis Turner and Wendell Scott (the latter hailing from nearby Danville, Va.)</p> <p>The track hosted SCCA Trans Am and IMSA endurance races (the first two of which were won by Porsche teammates Peter Gregg and Hurley Haywood), but with its remote location, far from the population centers that fill the spectator areas, VIR experienced financial problems and closed in 1974. Suddenly silent, the facility reverted to farm land.</p> <p>The 1,200-acre parcel still would be farmland today had New York real-estate developer and vintage racer Harvey Siegel not purchased it in 1998 and undertaken the herculean task of not only restoring the circuit, but bringing it up to world-class standards. While retaining the backbone of the original circuit, including its trademark Oak Tree turn, Siegel widened the track to 40 feet and gave it modern safety and convenience features. Today, VIRginia International Raceway (as it now bills itself) offers six configurations (Full Course - 3.27 miles; North Course - 2.25 miles; South Course - 1.65 miles; Patriot Course - 1.1 miles; Grand West - 3.97 Miles; and Grand East - 4.07 miles) of which 2 can always be run simultaneously.</p> <p>All of the courses are challenging, but the 3.27-mile Full Course, the track's original configuration, is a true classic. Straightaways of 3,000 and 4,000 feet yield terrific velocities for any race car, while a 130-foot elevation change adds more dimension to a driver's lap.</p> <p>And while the modern iteration of this classic road-racing facility focuses on amateur events, in addition to NASA amateur sports car events, SCCA national and regional club races, SVRA and HSR vintage competition, VIR hosts AMA motorcycle racing, Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482; and the Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series&#8482;. Today, with the tremendous population growth in Raleigh and Greensboro, just an hour's drive from the track, professional racing at VIR draws more than respectable crowds.</p>",

Summit Point opened in 1973 and while early in its history the track hosted professional road-racing series, in recent years the focus for the entire facility has been on amateur racing, high-performance driver training and club events.</p> <p>The Summit Point circuit, in either it's long or short configuration, is quite fast and features a 40-foot elevation change. The 2,900-foot pit straight is preceded by a fast right-hander, so speeds are high at the braking point for the acute corner at the end of the straight. Miss your braking point and you'll have a fast trip through tall grass. The fast downhill approach to the tight Wagon Wheel also requires careful and precise braking on the approach and careful throttle modulation all the way around the long corner.</p> <p>The Jefferson Circuit is a great learning tool, with seven turns - lefts, rights, switchbacks and elevation changes - crammed into barely more than a mile of pavement.</p>",

Designed and built in the late 1950s on the rolling, wooded sandhill country about 50 miles east of Toronto, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park's ten-turn, 2.459 mile track is widely-regarded as one of the most daunting road courses on the planet owing to an abundance of ultra-fast, blind corners, many of which feature dramatic elevation changes. However, the track's signature turn is Moss Corner, a double apex hairpin named in honor of Stirling Moss, who re-designed the corner after seeing its originally-planned configuration.</p> <p>Fittingly, Moss won the first major race held at Mosport (pronounced Moe-Sport as a contraction of the words \"motor\" and \"sport\") in a Lotus 19 in 1961. Canadian Tire Motorsport Park subsequently enjoyed tremendous popularity throughout the 1960s and became the traditional first round of the Can-Am Challenge Series. In 1967 Canadian Tire Motorsport Park staged the first true World Championship Canadian Grand Prix Formula One event, won by Jack Brabham. Together with Quebec's Circuit Mont Tremblant, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park hosted the Canadian Grand Prix on alternate years and, later, served as the event's permanent home from 1972 until the race moved to Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 1978.</p> <p>In addition to Formula One, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park also staged a couple of , USAC Indy car races in the late '60s and, after losing the Canadian Grand Prix to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, continued to host major motorcycle and sports car races including the IMSA Camel GT and, more recently, American Le Mans Series.</p> <p>Originally a publically-owned venture, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park saw a succession of owners including Norm Namerow and Harvey Huddes before the Panoz Motor Sports Group acquired the facility in 1998. The PMSG widened and repaved the track in 2001 in order to meet FIA specifications although, in contrast to the vast majority of road courses built in the 1950s and '60s still being utilized, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park's basic layout (and character) remains intact.</p> <p>In 1967, Jimmy Clark in his Lotus 49 Ford/Cosworth won the pole for the inaugural Canadian Grand Prix with a lap of 1:22.4. The current track record of 1:04.094 (138.116 mph) was established by Dindo Capello in an Audi R10 TDI in 2008.</p> <p>In addition to the 2.459 mile Grand Prix circuit, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park includes a half-mile paved oval; a 2.4 km advanced driver and race driver training facility with a quarter-mile skid pad (Canadian Tire Motorsport Park Driver Development Centre) and a 1.4 km kart track (Canadian Tire Motorsport Park International Karting).</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Australia's premier permanent road course, Phillip Island is a 2.7-mile (4.4 km) thrill ride of a race track situated on an island just off the southern coast near Melbourne. The 12-turn circuit features a long main straightaway, hair-raisingly fast turns, tight hairpins and dramatic elevation changes, including a precipitous drop from Lukey Heights to the tight Turn Ten. Set against the deep blue backdrop of the Bass Strait separating the Australian mainland from Tasmania, Phillip Island is among the world's spectacular motorsports venues.</p> <p>Phillip Island has a rich motorsports history dating back to the early twentieth century when the 10 Miles Road Race (since known as the inaugural Australian Grand Prix) was staged over one of the world's first \"ro-vals\" -- a rectangle of public roads with four identical corners. As speeds increased a new Phillip Island circuit was developed around an existing airfield and operated into the mid-1930s. In the aftermath of World War II, a new, permanent track was built on the edge of the island's south coast and hosted its first race in 1956. The facility experienced good times and bad, in part due to the track maintenance required by its roller-coaster character. The Phillip Island circuit closed its doors from 1962-66 and again from the late 1970s until it reopened in 1989 as the site of the Australian round of the World Motorcycle Championship.</p> <p>Phillip Island has since come to be regarded as one of the world's most challenging race tracks - be it on two or four wheels. The facility hosts world class auto and motorcycle racing each year including the Australian V8 Supercar Championship as well as the Australian MotoGP and a round of the World Superbike Championship.</p>",

The track has hosted every major American road racing series worthy of the name, and the list of drivers who have stood atop Mid-Ohio's victory podium is a Who's Who of racing greats. <p>Constructed near Mansfield, Ohio in 1962 by Les Griebling and several prominent local businessmen, Mid-Ohio originally featured a 2.4 mile, 15 turn layout consisting of a blend of fast, medium and slow speed corners, one long straightaway and several dramatic elevation changes. Although the track was updated over the years, Jim Trueman (founder of the Red Roof Inn motel chain and TrueSports Racing) thoroughly modernized the facility after acquiring the track in 1982. In addition to a new garage, paddock and operations tower, the update tweaked the track layout by by-passing the Keyhole chicane, resulting in an optional 2.25 mile, 13 turn circuit.</p> <p>Both configurations begin with the daunting Turn One, a blind, 100  mph corner, include a roller-coaster series of esse bends known as \"Madness\" and conclude with a near-360 degree Carousel that has a virtually unlimited number of lines and apexes. More recently, a \"short course\" was created by connecting the exit of Turn One to the backstraightaway, and there is also a new mini-oval utilizing the Keyhole Hairpin and another 180 degree turn linking the track on the approach and exit to the Keyhole.</p> <p>In its near-fifty year history, Mid-Ohio has hosted America's premier racing series including the United States Road Racing Championship, Can-Am, Trans-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA Camel GT, American Le Mans Series, Grand American Road Racing Championship, Champ Car World Series and the IZOD IndyCar Series&#8482;. As well, Mid-Ohio has long been a club racing mecca and enjoyed a 12 year run as the home of the Sports Car Club of America's National Championship Runoffs from 1994 through 2005.</p> <p>These days the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course schedule includes race weekends featuring the IZOD IndyCar Series&#8482;, the American Le Mans Series, the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482; and the American Motorcycle Association Pro Racing, together with SCCA and other amateur road racing competition.",

The 2,900-foot pit straight is preceded by a fast right-hander, so speeds are high at the braking point for the acute corner at the end of the straight. Miss your braking point and you'll have a fast trip through tall grass. The fast downhill approach to the tight Wagon Wheel also requires careful and precise braking on the approach and careful throttle modulation all the way around the long corner.</p> <p>The Jefferson Circuit is a great learning tool, with seven turns - lefts, rights, switchbacks and elevation changes - crammed into barely more than a mile of pavement.</p>",

The track that became known as the \"Indy of the East\" was born of the calamitous hurricane (\"The Long Island Express\") that devastated much of New England in 1938, including the Connecticut farm of John Hoening. Rather than rebuilding his farm, Hoening constructed the country's first paved race track on the site - a 5/8s mile oval with turns banked at 26 degrees.</p> <p>Hoening opened his Thompson International Speedway on May 26, 1940 for a race featuring what are now called sprint cars. Dizzy Vance won the track's debut event for car owner Louis D'Amore before an overflow crowd... and motor racing fans have been flocking to the northeast corner of Connecticut ever since.</p> <p>Following World War II, Thompson became a hotbed of stock car racing. In 1951, the newly-organized National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing (aka NASCAR) staged a Grand National race at Thompson won by Neil Cole. While the Grand National series (now NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482;) would return on a number of occasions with NASCAR legends like David Pearson and Bobby Issac visiting victory lane, Thompson's weekly racing series would be the springboard for many of stock racing's biggest stars. Daytona 500 winner Pete Hamilton, Talladega 500 winner Ron Bouchard, Pete Sacks, Jimmy Spencer and Geoffrey, Brett and Todd Bodine all cut their teeth at Thompson which has since added a \u00ba mile oval to the facility, complimenting the legendary 5/8 mile track.</p> <p>Today, seventy years on from its tumultuous birth, Thompson International Speedway remains in the capable hands of Hoening's son Donald, together with grandson D.R. Theirs continues to be one of the busiest race tracks in the country, running weekly stock car races for Sunoco Modifieds, Super Late Models, Late Models, Thompson Modifieds, Limited Sportsman, Mini-Stocks, Pro Four Modifieds as well as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series&#8482;.</p>",

Exactly one mile in length, Dover has some of the most extreme banking (24 degrees) on the NASCAR Cup Series circuit. Even the straights are banked at nine degrees. Did we mention Dover is one of only two Cup tracks (along with Bristol Motor Speedway) that features concrete pavement the whole way 'round?</p><p>Dover is also unique in that the track is part of a larger sports and entertainment complex that includes a hotel, gaming casino and harness racing track. But it's the mechanical ponies - as in the 750 horsepower NASCAR Cup Series machines and their sibling NASCAR Xfinity and Craftsman Truck Series racers - that grab the motorsports fans' attention each year.</p><p>Constructed between 1967 and '69, Dover Motor Speedway was initially paved with asphalt. It wasn't until 1995's comprehensive revamp that the track was paved in concrete, giving Dover's racing surface its distinctive white appearance - albeit with many shades of gray and black after a weekend's worth of rubber is laid down! No matter the pavement, Dover has long been one of the most competitive tracks on the NASCAR schedule. From 1969 through '80, 21 of the 22 Cup races at Dover Motor Speedway were won by drivers who either already had or would go on to win championships in NASCAR's top series.</p><p>The names of those winners are part of the fabric of the sport - Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Benny Parsons and Darrell Waltrip. Allison and Petty rank first on the all-time win list at Dover Motor Speedway with seven victories apiece. More recently, Jimmie Johnson (six), Jeff Gordon (four), Mark Martin (four) and a host of other stock car legends have added their names to the list of Dover Motor Speedway's winners, a list that also includes Scott Sharp and Greg Ray, who each won a race during Dover's cameo appearance on the Indy Racing League calendar in the late 1990s.</p>",

When the track's original surface of crushed stone and tar proved problematic, the owners paved the track with more than 3 million bricks, giving rise to its nickname: \"The Brickyard.\"</p> <p>It wasn't until Memorial Day of 1911, however, that the first 500 mile race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and won by Ray Harroun in his Marmon Wasp. What quickly became known as the Indianapolis 500 became one of the nation's leading sports events in the 1920s and '30s. To win the \"Indy 500\" was to achieve instant notoriety, and the names of early winners like Tommy Milton, Louis Meyer and Wilbur Shaw are indelibly etched in the annals of American motorsports.</p> <p>A nationwide ban on motorsports during World War II, however, nearly spelled the end for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which lay in virtual ruin when a consortium headed by Indiana businessman Tony Hulman purchased the facility in 1945. Hulman and his partners invested heavily in the facility and expanded the spectator capacity to the point that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway became the world's largest sporting arena (in terms of permanent seats) and the Indy 500 the world's largest single-day sports event with crowds regularly topping 350,000. The march of progress also included the gradual process of paving-over the bricks with a modern asphalt surface. By 1961 the resurfacing had been completed \u2013 leaving just the famous \"yard of bricks\" at the start/finish line as a tribute to the tradition of \"The Brickyard.\u201d</p> <p>The 1990s saw major changes to the Speedway. In 1994, IMS president Tony George (grandson of Tony Hulman) consummated an agreement with NASCAR to stage a stock car race - the Brickyard 400 - at the Speedway. Then in 2000, George brought Formula One racing back to the , USA after a nine-year absence, staging the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p> <p>To do so, however, required a massive renovation of the facility, including the construction of a 2.605-mile road course that combined a portion of the oval with a twisting infield section. Although the F1 race would only last through 2007, its place was been taken by Moto GP, enabling the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to return to its motorcycle roots. Beginning in 2014, the road course will also host the Grand Prix of Indianapolis IndyCar race as the kick-off to a month of May concluding with the Indianapolis 500 on its traditional Memorial Day weekend date. </p>",

The following year, Clay Regazzoni captured the inaugural U.S. Grand Prix (West) and in 1977 Mario Andretti passed Jody Scheckter in the closing laps to become the first American to win an F1 race on home ground.\nAndretti's popular victory put the race on firm financial footing and set in motion the rebirth of Long Beach, which morphed from a down-on-its heels port city to a thriving modern city/tourist destination. The resulting building boom necessitated ongoing changes to the track layout, finally settling on the current 1.968 mile, 11 turn circuit encircling the Long Beach Convention Center and the Long Beach Aquarium.</p>\n<p>Nor were the changes limited to the track and its environs. The Long Beach GP changed gears in 1984, bringing the home-grown Indy cars to town as the featured attraction. The event hardly missed a beat, as the names of Unser, Zanardi, Montoya, Franchitti and Power soon joined the likes of Regazzoni, Andretti, Villeneuve, Piquet and Lauda on the illustrious list of Long Beach winners. What's more, the event grew to include - at various times - the American Le Mans Series, GRAND-AM Sports Car Series and the Pirelli World Challenge, along with the popular Toyota Celebrity race in which Hollywood's famous (and near famous) exchange Armani and Gucci for Simpson and Bell.</p>\n<p>F1 or IndyCar, world class driver or movie star, the Long Beach Grand Prix circuit is as testing as they come ... with very hard walls eagerly awaiting the slightest mistake.</p>",

The racing surface is a uniform 57 feet wide throughout and includes a 12 foot apron, and the facility also includes a paved, quarter-mile oval which utilizes a portion of the pit lane and tri-oval. Sarah Fisher holds the absolute track record at Kentucky Speedway, having won the pole for the 2002 IndyCar race with a two lap average speed of 221.390 mph.</p> <p>Originally constructed by a group headed by Jerry Carroll, Kentucky Speedway was sold to Speedway Motorsports in 2008. Speedway Motorsports subsequently expanded the track's seating capacity from 66,000 to 107,000, reconfigured the pit lane to include the quarter-mile oval and acquired an additional 200 acres of property to be utilized for camping on race weekends.</p>",

The short Omloop van Terlaemen was built in 1961 and two years later (under the direction of noted race track designer Hans Hugenholz) was expanded to the basic layout of today's 2.492 mile (4.011 km) Circuit Zolder. Although the original circuit\u2019s succession of hair-raising sweeps and long straightaways has been modified for safety purposes, Circuit Zolder remains a fast and challenging track that nearly encircles a canal at one end and a forested motorhome park on the other!</p> <p>Circuit Zolder hosted the Belgian Grand Prix ten times in the 1970s and '80s, including the 1978 race debut of the Lotus 79 when Mario Andretti sat on pole by more than 1.5s. Sadly, Zolder was also the scene of Gilles Villeneuve\u2019s fatal accident during qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.</p> <p>More recently, Circuit Zolder has hosted a variety of top flight events including the FIA GT Series, the Champ Car World Series, the Belgian Moto GP and the 24 Hours of Zolder.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Belgium's \"other\" world class motorsports facility, Circuit Zolder has long played second fiddle to the iconic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. That's unfortunate, because Circuit Zolder is an exciting and historic race track in its own right.</p> <p>Although today's circuit was built in 1963, motor racing in the area dates to the 1950s when the local Zolder motor club organized races around the town square. The short Omloop van Terlaemen was built in 1961 and two years later (under the direction of noted race track designer Hans Hugenholz) was expanded to the basic layout of today's 2.492 mile (4.011 km) Circuit Zolder. Although the original circuit\u2019s succession of hair-raising sweeps and long straightaways has been modified for safety purposes, Circuit Zolder remains a fast and challenging track that nearly encircles a canal at one end and a forested motorhome park on the other!</p> <p>Circuit Zolder hosted the Belgian Grand Prix ten times in the 1970s and '80s, including the 1978 race debut of the Lotus 79 when Mario Andretti sat on pole by more than 1.5s. Sadly, Zolder was also the scene of Gilles Villeneuve\u2019s fatal accident during qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.</p> <p>More recently, Circuit Zolder has hosted a variety of top flight events including the FIA GT Series, the Champ Car World Series, the Belgian Moto GP and the 24 Hours of Zolder.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Langley Speedway is among the most historic - and busiest - race tracks in America. Immediately adjacent to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA, the relatively flat, .395 mile asphalt oval has been the launching pad for many NASCAR careers including those of Denny Hamlin and Elliott Sadler, and was the site of nine NASCAR Grand National races won by the likes of Ned Jarrett, Bobby Isaac, Bobby Allison, David Pearson and, of course, Richard Petty.</p> <p>Langley's heritage dates to the 1940s when the property was the site of an 8/10 mile dirt horse race track known as the Dude Ranch. The track owners occasionally promoted auto races at the track and, by the 1950s, realized the auto races attracted bigger crowds than the horse races. They shortened the track to its current length and eventually sold the facility to Harry Kilch in 1963. Kilch immediately set about making improvements to the rough and tumble track and hosted NASCAR Grand National Series events between 1964 and 1970. Langley was paved in 1968 and, two years later, hosted the final Grand National race before the series was renamed the Winston Cup.</p> <p>Today, under the ownership of former racer/area businessman Bill Mullis, Langley Speedway hosts a variety of NASCAR-sanctioned series including the Whelen All-American Series. The track currently hosts 11 divisions which alternate running during their Saturday night program: Late Models, Grand Stock, Modifieds, Legends cars, Super Street, UCAR, Pro Six, Super Trucks, HRKC Pro Winged Champ Karts, and Enduros.</p>",

A Bose sound system ensures that everyone in the 15,000-seat grandstand can hear the announcer over the roar of the racing engines.</p> <p>NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Series&#8482; and Legends Cars are among the large number of classes that compete regularly at Irwindale. (Others include , USAC Midgets and Sprint Cars, Supermodifieds, Super Late Models, Trucks, Mini Stocks. To say nothing of drawing big crowds for drifting events and serving as the site for the world-record setting run by a radio-control car - 111 mph!)</p> <p>While Angelenos call it their home-town short track, Irwindale draws national attention for two of its annual special events. As the inheritor of short-track racing tradition in Southern California, Irwindale hosts the legendary Turkey Night Grand Prix, a series of Thanksgiving weekend races for Midgets and Sprint Cars that goes back to the 1950s.

Through a national employment relief effort during The Depression, local and federal government developed what had been a dirt-track/tourist drive into a race track. Mt Panorama's first event was staged on April, 1938 and \u2013 apart from the years during World War II \u2013 the circuit has been in regular use ever since.

    "detail_copy": "<p>Major league auto racing arrived in New England in style when New Hampshire Motor Speedway opened its gates in the summer of 1990. The first superspeedway constructed in the United States in twenty years, NHMS heralded the start of a construction frenzy that would see more than a dozen new speedways built around the country by the close of the decade. Many of the new tracks would be faster, some more ostentatious, but none placed a premium on car and driver like NHMS.</p> <p>Just over a mile in length, NHMS' oval is a classic \"paper-clip\" design with long straightaways and tight, flat turns. Not surprisingly, the track rewards cars that have plenty of \"grunt\" off the corners and brakes capable of getting things slowed-down at the end of the front straightaway and the backstretch... not to mention drivers who can baby those brakes from start to finish in races lasting three hours or more while making their cars work high and low in the turns.</p> <p>Speaking of more, there's more to NHMS than the one mile oval. In keeping with a heritage dating back to 1965 when the site was home to twisty Bryar Motorsports Park, NHMS offers top-flight road racing. Although the configurations incorporate different portions of the oval and twisting infield roads, they all utilize a breathtaking loop that climbs into the countryside beyond the backstretch to a 180 degree bowl of a turn before plunging back down to the oval.</p> <p>With an oval hosting a full slate of NASCAR competition including NASCAR Cup Series, Craftsman Truck Series, and Whelen Modified Tour events, road courses that are home to a variety of SCCA and vintage sports car events, as well as motorcycle races and permanent seating for more than 105,000 spectators, it's no wonder NHMS is the undisputed home of motorsports in New England. Nor was it any wonder when founders Bob and Gary Bahre decided to sell the facility in 2008 that Bruton Smith and Speedway Motorsports Inc. were happy to make them an offer they couldn't refuse.</p>",

The FIA issued its final approval of the circuit in September of 2012 some sixty days before the inaugural Formula One race.</p> <p>The 3.427-mile (5.515 km) Grand Prix circuit features CoTA's signature corner \u2013 Turn One, a tight hairpin at the crest of a 133 ft rise - followed by a rapid descent into a series of fast, sweeping corners leading to another hairpin. From there the cars follow a .62 mile straight (1.0 km) before a complex series of multi-apex corners in a stadium-like setting returns the cars to the pit straightaway. The facility also includes a shorter 2.6 mile (4.184 km) National circuit which, like the Grand Prix circuit, runs counter clockwise.</p> <p>In addition to the state-of-the-art circuit, pit and garage facilities, CoTA features impressive spectator and VIP amenities including a 251 feet (77 m) tall observation tower, several stadium grandstand seating sections and spectator mounds for general admission viewing. Along with Formula One, CoTA has hosted the V8 SuperCars Series, MotoGP, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the American Le Mans Series and the GRAND-AM Sports Car Series (now combined into the United SportsCar Championship) as well as various club and vintage events.</p>",

The 'Ring boasts an elevation gain/loss of nearly 1,000 feet per lap and many of its 73 bends like the Hatzenbach, Adenauer Forst, Wehrseifen, the Karussell, Pflanzgarten and Schwalbenschwanz are steeped in motorsports lore.</p>\n<p>Constructed between 1925-27, the N\u00fcrburgring originally consisted of two circuits - the 14.1-mile Nordschleife and a companion 4.8-mile S\u00fcdschleife which were occasionally combined to form a mammoth, 17.6-mile Gesamtstrecke. The Nordschleife, however, was the centerpiece of the facility and hosted the German Grand Prix Formula One and 1000K sports car races through the 1970s when major safety renovations were implemented. But the 1976 German Grand Prix saw world champion Niki Lauda nearly perish in a fiery accident and the race was subsequently moved to Hockenheim.</p>\n<p>However, the German Grand Prix returned to the N\u00fcrburgring after the Nordschleife's start/finish area and much of the S\u00fcdschleife were demolished to create a modern circuit - the 3.2-mile Grand-Prix-Strecke in 1982-83. While the modern circuit played host to the German Grand Prix (and occasionally the European Grand Prix) from 1984-2014), the German Touring Car Championship and other events, the Nordschleife (shortened to 12.9 miles to make way for the GP-Strecke) is still used for testing and club races and, in combination with the GP-Strecke, the 24 Hours of the N\u00fcrburgring. When not in use for races and testing, the Nordschleife is open to the public for lapping days.</p>",

Equally, the roll call of Williams Grove winners begins with the legendary Tommy Hinnershitz (winner of the first race on May, 21, 1939) and encompasses names like Ted Horn, Gordon Johncock, Herb Thomas, Lynn Paxton, Jan Opperman, Steve Kinser and Sammy Swindell not to mention Keith Kauffman, Fred Rahmer, Lucas Wolfe, Lance Dewease, Donny Kreitz Jr. and other members of the 'Pennsylvania Posse'.</p><p>Likewise, Williams Grove has featured nearly every category of dirt car racing during its weekly schedule, from 'big cars' and jalopy and street stocks, midgets, Grand National stock cars and dirt Champ Cars to late models, super modifieds and, most notably, and sprint cars.  The track stages a World of Outlaws v Pennsylvania Posse competition for the Morgan Cup each spring while October brings the $50,000-to-win World of Outlaws National Open. </p>",

    "detail_copy": "Michigan International Speedway was completely rebuilt by iRacing, including the new track surface in 2018.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nOriginally designed by Charles Moneypenny, the same architect who created Daytona International speedway, and located in the vacation-area Irish Hills of the south-central part of the state, Michigan International Speedway is best-known for the awesome speeds and competitive racing spawned by its broad racing surface and 73-foot-wide, 18-degree banked turns. Michigan's width and steep banking ensure there's always more than one racing groove, and the fact that MIS is a non-restrictor-plate track means drivers have more than enough power to make a challenge out of the turns at both ends of the track.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nOnce upon a time Indy cars frolicked on those high banks at breathtaking speeds, witness Paul Tracy's record qualifying lap of 234.949 mph. Today, Michigan regularly vies with Daytona, Talladega and Texas as NASCAR's fastest speedway, with Ryan Newman holding the NASCAR Cup Series track record of 194.232 mph. While MIS' Stirling Moss-designed 3.1-mile road course and the Can-Am and Trans-Am races of days gone-by are now just fond memories, the track has a 1.9-mile interior road course that has challenged IMSA and amateur racers down through the years.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nIt's no wonder some of stock car racing's most legendary drivers have thrived on the banks of MIS since Cale Yarborough defeated Lee Roy Yarbrough in the inaugural NASCAR race there in 1969. Richard Petty and David Pearson, Bobby and Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt Senior and Junior, Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson have all since added their names to the roll call of MIS winners, one that also includes names like Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Rick Mears and Alex Zanardi from the days when Indy cars raced in the Irish Hills, not to mention Parnelli Jones and Mark Donohue, Trans-Am winners on the MIS road course that, once upon a time, snaked through the countryside behind the backstretch. Allison to Yarborough, Andretti to Zanardi, the world's greatest race drivers have been coming to Michigan International Speedway to test their mettle for more than 40 years. And the fans have followed by the hundreds of thousands.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nDetroit-area real-estate developer Larry LoPatin had the vision to build first Michigan International Speedway and then a Southwestern duplicate, Texas World Speedway in College Station, TX. But LoPatin's reach exceeded his grasp and it was a fellow named Roger Penske who stepped in and turned MIS into an auto-racing showcase. Under Penske's direction, MIS grew from a rather modest seating capacity of 25,000 to more than 125,000 between 1972 and '99. And the first order of business when the International Speedway Corporation acquired the facility from Penske? Add another 10,000 seats in Turn Three, enhancing MIS' status as the largest sports facility in the Wolverine State.",

Situated in the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania , the 2.5 mile tri-oval features three very different turns connected by straightaways of varying length. Turn One is banked at 14 degrees, Turn Two (aka the \"Tunnel Turn\") is banked at eight degrees and Turn Three at six degrees. Pocono's main straightaway is the longest on any North American speedway at 3,740 feet, the \"Long Pond\" straightaway stretches for 3,055 feet between Turns One and Two, while the run from Turn Two to Turn Three is a mere 1,780 feet.</p> <p>The resulting speedway poses special demands on drivers and engineer alike, for a chassis that works well on the steeply-banked Turn One will be less than ideal for the flatter Turn Two, let alone Turn Three, and the downforce necessary for maximum grip in any of the turns will slow a car on the two long straightaways. And Turn Three requires heavy braking - in some cases even a gear change - making Pocono Raceway among the world's most challenging speedways.</p> <p>Pocono Raceway first opened for business in 1969 featuring a three quarter mile oval. The 2.5 mile speedway was completed in 1971 and immediately began hosting one of the jewels in Indy car racing triple crown of 500 mile races. Local hero Mario Andretti battled the likes of A.J. Foyt, Al and Bobby Unser, Johnny Rutherford and Gordon Johncock in , USAC-sanctioned Indy car races. NASCAR was also at Pocono from the early days, as witnessed by the fact that Richard Petty won NASCAR's inaugural Pocono 500 in 1974. Pocono also staged a number of top flight sports car races on its combination road course/oval layouts in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as various short track events on the original three-quarter mile oval encircling the main pit area.</p> <p>Located equa-distantly from New York City and Philadelphia - and with the rabid race fans of central Pennsylvania nearby - the track attracts overflow crowds for its two NASCAR weekends. Since Petty's win in 1974, the greatest names in stock car racing have visited Victory Lane at Pocono... not to mention Denny Hamlin who attributed much of his early success at Pocono to his sim-racing experience! Modern Pocono race weekends include all three of NASCAR\u2019s premier national series, as well as the ARCA Menards Series.</p>",

The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p> <p>With 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p> <p>Opened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth. The track hosts events for all three of NASCAR\u2019s national series and the ARCA Menards Series, has gone through dirt makeovers to welcome World of Outlaws events as well as the Cup Series\u2019 only dirt race multiple times in its history.</p>",

Those are the words most commonly associated with Brands Hatch, a former home of the British Grand Prix and a favorite of race drivers and fans alike.</p> <p>Situated some 30 miles southeast of London, Brands Hatch was the scene of motorcycle events in the 1920s on a three quarter mile dirt track carved out of a forested bowl that continues to be a distinguishing feature of the facility. Following World War II the oval was paved and modified to include the Druids Bend hairpin. With the construction of permanent pit facilities, Brands Hatch became one of the major motorsports venues in England. The facility was further enhanced in 1959 with the addition of more than a mile of track that brought the full circuit to 2.3 miles in length, with the original track serving as the nucleus for today's club circuit.</p> <p>Both circuits are renowned for their demanding layouts and dramatic elevation changes, exemplified by the turn known as Paddock Hill Bend. Approached along the curving pit straightaway, \"Paddock\" features a blind, uphill approach to an off-camber apex beyond the crest of the hill. Next, the road plunges downhill then climbs abruptly to Druids Bend before diving down through Graham Hill Bend to Cooper Straight . . . and that's just the first half mile.</p> <p>Brands Hatch hosted its first major international race in 1960, when Jack Brabham won the non-championship Silver City Trophy Formula One race, and was selected as the site of the British Grand Prix four years later. Subsequently, Brands Hatch alternated with Silverstone as the home of the British Grand Prix, producing many noteworthy winners from Jim Clark to Niki Lauda and Alan Jones.</p> <p>Although safety concerns saw the British GP move to Silverstone in 1987, Brands Hatch continues to host leading international and national events including the World and British Touring Car Championships, the FIA Formula Two and British Formula Three championships and the British Superbike Championship as well the Formula Ford Festival which has served as a springboard for the likes of Derek Daly, Mark Webber and Jenson Button.</p> <p>Brands Hatch has also hosted Indy car races on two occasions, indeed the 1.2 mile club track's official name is the Indy circuit. Rick Mears won a USAC-sanctioned race there in 1978 while Sebastien Bourdais claimed the first of his 31 Champ Car wins on the Indy circuit 25 years later.</p>",

Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for NASCAR Cup Series drivers to cope with.

This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety of names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio). While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur, and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten.

Just a year after the first race the 1.5-mile the oval track was in bankruptcy, done in by a huge infield rock formation that ballooned construction costs far beyond what its two founders had forecast.</p> <p>Almost 60 years later nearly everything is different. More than 89,000 seats ring the race track, which was the first superspeedway to install lights for night racing; the first race track to incorporate a condominium apartment complex overlooking the racing surface; the first to build an office complex with the same view; the first race track to sell naming rights; and the first to open a year-round club where members can spectate during races and socialize with fellow club members at other times. With the legendary H.A. \u201cHumpy\u201d Wheeler managing the day-to-day operations and promoting the races with flair and imagination, the track was soon among the most successful in the world.</p> <p>Everything is very different from 1960 except for one thing: Charlotte Motor Speedway is still owned by a Smith. Bruton handed the reins of Speedway Motorsports, the track\u2019s parent company, to his son Marcus in 2015 before passing away in 2022.</p> <p>The Charlotte Motor Speedway built a new infield road course, designed specifically for NASCAR competition, in 2018. While it has been revised multiple times since then, each version has utilized nearly all of the 1.5 mile oval as well as a newly built infield portion \u2013 thus the name Roval (Road/Oval).</p> <p>Each Roval configuration challenges the best of drivers and teams. Car setups are typically compromises \u2013 a car good on the oval may not be so good in the infield and vice versa so drivers and crew chiefs have to decide what matters most to them. Two chicanes, one on the back straight and one just before the start finish line, make for some exciting passing opportunities as competitors can attempt to outbrake each other.</p>",

Without sun or wind to harm it, the indoor garden (roughly a quarter-mile circle) is heavily saturated so that the boldest dirt track artists of our time can truly shine. It accommodates over two hundred race rigs, bleachers for thousands of people and an ever-growing trade show.

There are two main configurations, Course 1000 and Course 2000, with multiple variations of both. This makes the track a perfect fit for the iRacing base package as it can be used in multiple series without becoming repetitive.</p><p>Course 2000 is just over 2 KM in length and features 14 turns. Course 1000 is approximately 1 KM and has 11 turns. While the two main configurations share the same facilities, they are completely independent of each other and don't share any racing surface.</p><p>The tracks proximity to Tokyo, Japan has made it extremely popular with local car tuners who compete in Time Attack competitions. Expect to see Tsukuba Circuit feature in both race series and time attack competitions on iRacing.</p>",

Just a year after the first race the 1.5-mile the oval track was in bankruptcy, done in by a huge infield rock formation that ballooned construction costs far beyond what its two founders had forecast.</p> <p>Almost 60 years later nearly everything is different. More than 89,000 seats ring the race track, which was the first superspeedway to install lights for night racing; the first race track to incorporate a condominium apartment complex overlooking the racing surface; the first to build an office complex with the same view; the first race track to sell naming rights; and the first to open a year-round club where members can spectate during races and socialize with fellow club members at other times. With the legendary H.A. \u201cHumpy\u201d Wheeler managing the day-to-day operations and promoting the races with flair and imagination, the track was soon among the most successful in the world.</p> <p>Everything is very different from 1960 except for one thing: Charlotte Motor Speedway is still owned by a Smith. Bruton handed the reins of Speedway Motorsports, the track\u2019s parent company, to his son Marcus in 2015 before passing away in 2022.</p> <p>The Charlotte Motor Speedway built a new infield road course, designed specifically for NASCAR competition, in 2018. While it has been revised multiple times since then, each version has utilized nearly all of the 1.5 mile oval as well as a newly built infield portion \u2013 thus the name Roval (Road/Oval).</p> <p>Each Roval configuration challenges the best of drivers and teams. Car setups are typically compromises \u2013 a car good on the oval may not be so good in the infield and vice versa so drivers and crew chiefs have to decide what matters most to them. Two chicanes, one on the back straight and one just before the start finish line, make for some exciting passing opportunities as competitors can attempt to outbrake each other.</p>",

Its addition to the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series schedule for 2025 marks the first time the track has seen one of NASCAR\u2019s three premier national series.</p> <p>With seven corners and multiple long straightaways on its classic layout, Lime Rock Park is also one of the fastest road courses in North America. For that reason, it also features multiple chicanes that are occasionally used as part of different layouts to slow cars down. Under a unique injunction present for most of the track\u2019s history, Sunday racing is not allowed at Lime Rock Park, but unmuffled Friday and Saturday events are common. For its extensive history and iconic layout, the track was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.</p>",

In the wake of Hurricane Andrew in August, 1992, South Florida racing promoter Ralph Sanchez began organizing construction of the region's first major-league motorsports facility as part of the reconstruction of the devastated Homestead community. Ground-breaking took place the following August and on Aug. 24, 1993, the first event, a NASCAR Xfinity Series race, was won by Dale Jarrett.</p> <p>Longtime host to NASCARs season finale for the top three series, the 1.5-mile variable-banked Homestead-Miami oval has also hosted Indycar and IMSA events. SCCA amateur races and CSS motorcycle races also take place on the road circuit.</p> <p>With more than a thousand palm trees and a Caribbean color scheme, the facility projects a South Beach flavor that distinguishes Homestead-Miami from other major race tracks in America. It took a while longer to get the right combination for the racing surface. In its first iteration, the track had four separate low-banked corners - that configuration failed to promote good racing, and unfortunately also provided bad crash angles. Widening the aprons failed to correct either of these problems.</p> <p>A major reconfiguration of the track during the summer of 1997 brought a more conventional layout - sweeping 180-degree corners at either end of the oval. Close, but still no cigar. But the most recent work on the track, during which the track assumed variable banking - up to 20 degrees in the corners, flattening to 3 degrees on the straightaways - has done the trick. Everyone agrees, at Homestead-Miami, the beauty is now more than skin deep.</p>",

The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p> <p>With 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p> <p>Opened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth. The track hosts events for all three of NASCAR\u2019s national series and the ARCA Menards Series, has gone through dirt makeovers to welcome World of Outlaws events as well as the Cup Series\u2019 only dirt race multiple times in its history.</p>",

The story goes that Staley and his partners ran out of money to create their perfect oval, leaving the track with an uphill slope on the backstretch, and a downhill slope to the finish. Such was born one of the most unique short tracks in NASCAR history, a .625-mile oval that hosted the premier Cup Series twice a year until 1996.</p> <p>From the second that last checkered flag fell, race fans clamored for the return of North Wilkesboro. After a series of restoration efforts, the track was digitally restored to its 1987 state for iRacing in 2020, giving iRacers the opportunity to go back in time and relive the iconic North Carolina short track as it existed in its heyday. Such was the popularity of its virtual return that real-world NASCAR Cup Series racing returned in 2023 with the annual All-Star Race, and the track received numerous site upgrades, including a repave. Now, iRacers have the option of running both modern and vintage versions of the track.</p>",

Just a year after the first race the 1.5-mile the oval track was in bankruptcy, done in by a huge infield rock formation that ballooned construction costs far beyond what its two founders had forecast.</p> <p>Almost 60 years later nearly everything is different. More than 89,000 seats ring the race track, which was the first superspeedway to install lights for night racing; the first race track to incorporate a condominium apartment complex overlooking the racing surface; the first to build an office complex with the same view; the first race track to sell naming rights; and the first to open a year-round club where members can spectate during races and socialize with fellow club members at other times. With the legendary H.A. \u201cHumpy\u201d Wheeler managing the day-to-day operations and promoting the races with flair and imagination, the track was soon among the most successful in the world.</p> <p>Everything is very different from 1960 except for one thing: Charlotte Motor Speedway is still owned by a Smith. Bruton handed the reins of Speedway Motorsports, the track\u2019s parent company, to his son Marcus in 2015 before passing away in 2022.</p> <p>The Charlotte Motor Speedway built a new infield road course, designed specifically for NASCAR competition, in 2018. While it has been revised multiple times since then, each version has utilized nearly all of the 1.5 mile oval as well as a newly built infield portion \u2013 thus the name Roval (Road/Oval).</p> <p>Each Roval configuration challenges the best of drivers and teams. Car setups are typically compromises \u2013 a car good on the oval may not be so good in the infield and vice versa so drivers and crew chiefs have to decide what matters most to them. Two chicanes, one on the back straight and one just before the start finish line, make for some exciting passing opportunities as competitors can attempt to outbrake each other.</p>",

Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for NASCAR Cup Series drivers to cope with. Keeping the tires and brakes in good working order while maintaining a competitive pace is one of the bigger challenges these drivers face all year.</p> <p>Most other road-racing classes that compete at Sonoma use the full 2.52-mile, 12-turn circuit, while INDYCAR and AMA motorcycle events have used a modified 2.22 mile (3.57 km), 12 turn course. This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety or names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio). While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted , USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten. A $60 million improvement program, begun in 2000, has catapulted Sonoma Raceway into the top rank of American motorsport facilities.</p>",

While the track would eventually be reconfigured multiple times before taking its current shape, the quality of names on track remained the same, with legends like Jack Ingram and Harry Gant earning titles of their own later on.</p><p>For much of its history, Hickory played host to what is now known as the NASCAR Xfinity Series, and it even hosted nearly two decades of NASCAR Cup Series racing before the 1972 schedule shift that consolidated the division.

The 1.267-mile road course was formed by connecting service roads to a mineral railway that had been out of service for more than 20 years, and has been a regular host of both professional and amateur British and Scottish racing events ever since its opening in 1974.</p><p>Knockhill packs a big punch in a small space, not only for its numerous track layouts, but also for being the United Kingdom's first track to gain certification to run in both directions in the modern era in 2012. Between its International and National layouts, a half-mile tri-oval, and an interior section utilized for rallycross and supermoto racing, its utility for just about any type of racing imaginable has been proven time and again.</p><p>The International layout, however, is the best known, as it's used for top-tier events like the British Touring Car and Superbike Championships. Knockhill features nine corners and over 120 feet of elevation changes on its main layout, with lengthy straightaways both leading into and out of the final corner, known as Taylor's hairpin. Aside from racing, demonstration runs in Formula 1 cars and driving experiences ranging from the world's top supercars to entry-level cars for junior drivers are mainstays of the track's annual program.",

Between its International and National layouts, a half-mile tri-oval, and an interior section utilized for rallycross and supermoto racing, its utility for just about any type of racing imaginable has been proven time and again.</p><p>The International layout, however, is the best known, as it's used for top-tier events like the British Touring Car and Superbike Championships. Knockhill features nine corners and over 120 feet of elevation changes on its main layout, with lengthy straightaways both leading into and out of the final corner, known as Taylor's hairpin. Aside from racing, demonstration runs in Formula 1 cars and driving experiences ranging from the world's top supercars to entry-level cars for junior drivers are mainstays of the track's annual program.",

The stadium has even hosted dozens of major off-road motorsport events, with trucks and cars jumping in and out of the Coliseum entrance every lap.</p> <p>In 2022, NASCAR became the latest major league sport to join the venue's legacy with the Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum. A quarter-mile circuit constructed within stadium walls will see the annual preseason all-star race of the NASCAR Cup Series leave Daytona for the first time. The track was designed and tested by iRacing in cooperation with NASCAR in advance of the unique event, with top real-world and sim racing pros all logging countless laps before both its release on iRacing and real-world debut. The change in venue also leads to a change in format, with qualifying heats to build the feature grid in a manner similar to a local short track race.</p> <p>Now's your chance to take the wheel in a unique part of NASCAR history in one of America's most iconic sporting venues.

The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p> <p>With 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p> <p>Opened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth. The track hosts events for all three of NASCAR\u2019s national series and the ARCA Menards Series, has gone through dirt makeovers to welcome World of Outlaws events as well as the Cup Series\u2019 only dirt race multiple times in its history.</p>",

Spectators from that day, who watched from one small grandstand or on blankets spread out on an adjacent dirt bank, wouldn't begin to recognize the facility today, even down to the name. Dubbed Atlanta International Raceway when it opened, the track struggled financially through the '60s and '70s before finding a degree of stability in the '80s. (Future Georgia governor and President of the United States Jimmy Carter briefly worked as a ticket-seller on race weekends in the '60s.)</p> <p>Real change came following Bruton Smith's purchase of the facility in 1990, with the culmination of the transformation of Atlanta International Speedway occurring in 1997, with extensive reconfiguration that switched front and back straightaways and added a double-dogleg in the new front straightaway. In the seven intervening years, new grandstands sprouted almost every year, and a nine-story tower, Tara Place, that houses the track offices and a number of luxury condominiums. And the building continues to this day; in 2006 the Winners Grandstand was erected overlooking the double-dogleg front stretch and pits, and atop the new private-membership Club One, which features climate-controlled views of the entire track.</p> <p>In 2018 iRacing added two Rallycross configurations to the infield (Long & Short), further adding to the utility of the track. In 2021, with the help of iRacing, the track was dramatically reprofiled once again, this time narrowing and adding banking to its corners to create superspeedway-style racing. EchoPark Automotive, another company owned by the Smith family, became Atlanta\u2019s title sponsor in 2025.</p>",

Born in 1957 during the initial blitz of U.S. road-racing circuit development, VIR was one of the major sports car racing facilities during the 1960s. Cobra legend Carroll Shelby won the inaugural race behind the wheel of a Maserati 450 S, and over the years races at VIR produced fields populated by sports car stars Carl Haas, Bob Holbert, Augie Pabst, Bob Grossman, Don Yenko, Dick Thompson, Walt Hansgen and Bruce Jennings and NASCAR legends such as Richard Petty, David Pearson, Curtis Turner and Wendell Scott (the latter hailing from nearby Danville, Va.)</p> <p>The track hosted SCCA Trans Am and IMSA endurance races (the first two of which were won by Porsche teammates Peter Gregg and Hurley Haywood), but with its remote location, far from the population centers that fill the spectator areas, VIR experienced financial problems and closed in 1974. Suddenly silent, the facility reverted to farm land.</p> <p>The 1,200-acre parcel still would be farmland today had New York real-estate developer and vintage racer Harvey Siegel not purchased it in 1998 and undertaken the herculean task of not only restoring the circuit, but bringing it up to world-class standards. While retaining the backbone of the original circuit, including its trademark Oak Tree turn, Siegel widened the track to 40 feet and gave it modern safety and convenience features. Today, VIRginia International Raceway (as it now bills itself) offers six configurations (Full Course - 3.27 miles; North Course - 2.25 miles; South Course - 1.65 miles; Patriot Course - 1.1 miles; Grand West - 3.97 Miles; and Grand East - 4.07 miles) of which 2 can always be run simultaneously.</p> <p>All of the courses are challenging, but the 3.27-mile Full Course, the track's original configuration, is a true classic. Straightaways of 3,000 and 4,000 feet yield terrific velocities for any race car, while a 130-foot elevation change adds more dimension to a driver's lap.</p> <p>And while the modern iteration of this classic road-racing facility focuses on amateur events, in addition to NASA amateur sports car events, SCCA national and regional club races, SVRA and HSR vintage competition, VIR hosts AMA motorcycle racing, Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482; and the Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series&#8482;. Today, with the tremendous population growth in Raleigh and Greensboro, just an hour's drive from the track, professional racing at VIR draws more than respectable crowds.</p>",

The nine-turn layout begins with a hard left-hander coming off of the long frontstretch, but it also features multiple long, sweeping right-handers and a tricky complex comprising Turns 3 through 5. The track has hosted everything from the NASCAR Cup Series in the 1950s to budget-level endurance racing in modern times. It's also beloved among the amateur racing community for producing exciting racing with an approachable but fun layout.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>Circuit Zandvoort ranks among the most historic and challenging road courses in all of Europe. Home of the Dutch Grand Prix from 1952 to 1985, and again since 2021, Zandvoort features a testing blend of straightaways, tight, medium and high-speed turns that run over and around the sand dunes just a few hundred yards from the North Sea.</p> <p>Designed by John Hugenholtz, the Zandvoort circuit opened in 1948. The 2.6 mile road course, located west of Amsterdam, boasted a couple of signature corners, including the fast and undulating Scheivlak, and Tarzanbocht a slightly-banked 180 degree turn at the end of the long pit straightaway. Coupled with the heavy braking at the end of the straightaway, the modest banking encouraged overtaking maneuvers, the most famous of which resulted in Mario Andretti and James Hunt banging wheels during the 1977 Dutch Grand Prix.</p> <p>Over the years, Zandvoort witnessed many classic races. In 1959 Jo Bonnier scored B.R.M's first Formula One victory there. Eight years later the legendary Ford Cosworth DFV earned a famous win in its competition debut in the hands of Jimmy Clark, one of four Dutch Grand Prix wins for the Scotsman. The rain-swept '71 Dutch Grand Prix featured a showdown between the two great rainmeisters of the day - Jacky Ickx and Pedro Rodriguez - that was ultimately resolved in the Belgian's favor. A partial list of Ickx' fellow Dutch GP winners includes Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, James Hunt, Alan Prost and Niki Lauda.</p> <p>Following the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix the circuit closed owing to financial problems. It reopened four years later as Circuit Park Zandvoort and featured an abbreviated (1.6 mile) version of the original track for use in club racing. In 1995, however, the Dutch government gave the CPZ the go-ahead to develop a new international level circuit. The resulting facility opened in 2001, featuring a modern pit complex as well as the old Tarzanbocht and the new Arie Luyendyk-bocht, which honors the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner who cut his racing teeth at Zandvoort.</p> <p>The contemporary Circuit Zandvoort boasts four different configurations ranging in length from 2.64 to .87 miles. It was reconfigured and brought up to modern standards in anticipation of hosting the Dutch Grand Prix once again in 2020, though the COVID-19 pandemic postponed that for a year. In addition to a full slate of amateur and club races, Circuit Zandvoort annually hosts rounds of national and international sports car races.

After the slow La Carrierrasse left-hander, drivers accelerate through La Courmelle and downhill into the Virage du Camion, before Le Cavalet turns them hard right and uphill once again.

Its most famous race each year is the Slinger Nationals, a 200-lap Super Late Model race that has been won by some of the biggest names in short track racing and NASCAR alike; former Cup Series champion Matt Kenseth holds the record with eight wins between 1994 and 2019. Slinger also has a paved X running through its center to host Figure 8 events.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>The first motorsports competition at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway took place in 1909 in form of motorcycle races and automobile races soon followed. When the track's original surface of crushed stone and tar proved problematic, the owners paved the track with more than 3 million bricks, giving rise to its nickname: \"The Brickyard.\"</p><p>\r\nIt wasn't until Memorial Day of 1911, however, that the first 500 mile race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and won by Ray Harroun in his Marmon Wasp. What quickly became known as the Indianapolis 500 became one of the nation's leading sports events in the 1920s and '30s. To win the \"Indy 500\" was to achieve instant notoriety, and the names of early winners like Tommy Milton, Louis Meyer and Wilbur Shaw are indelibly etched in the annals of American motorsports.</p><p>\r\nA nationwide ban on motorsports during World War II, however, nearly spelled the end for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which lay in virtual ruin when a consortium headed by Indiana businessman Tony Hulman purchased the facility in 1945. Hulman and his partners invested heavily in the facility and expanded the spectator capacity to the point that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway became the world's largest sporting arena (in terms of permanent seats) and the Indy 500 the world's largest single-day sports event with crowds regularly topping 350,000. The march of progress also included the gradual process of paving-over the bricks with a modern asphalt surface. By 1961 the resurfacing had been completed \u2013 leaving just the famous \"yard of bricks\" at the start/finish line as a tribute to the tradition of \"The Brickyard.\"</p><p>\r\nThe 1990s saw major changes to the Speedway. In 1994, IMS president Tony George (grandson of Tony Hulman) consummated an agreement with NASCAR to stage a stock car race - the Brickyard 400 - at the Speedway. Then in 2000, George brought Formula One racing back to the , USA after a nine-year absence, staging the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p><p>\r\nTo do so, however, required a massive renovation of the facility, including the construction of a 2.605-mile road course that combined a portion of the oval with a twisting infield section. Although the F1 race would only last through 2007, its place was been taken by Moto GP, enabling the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to return to its motorcycle roots. Beginning in 2014, the road course will also host the Grand Prix of Indianapolis IndyCar race as the kick-off to a month of May concluding with the Indianapolis 500 on its traditional Memorial Day weekend date.</p><p>\r\nAs of 2022, iRacing's version of Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been updated with all-new scans of the oval and road course added to the original configurations.</p>",

The Huset's High Bank Nationals and Huset's Hustle for sprint cars each offer six-figure payouts to their winners, while the Silver Dollar Nationals pay $75,000 to win for top late model racers.

In the 1980s the drag strip was lengthened to \u00bc mile, a 2.6 mile road course was added and the facility was renamed Gateway International Raceway. The track was acquired in 1995 by Dover Motorsports Inc. which constructed a 1.25 mile, egg-shaped oval and 1.65 mile road course utilizing the infield and Turns 3 and 4 of the oval. Although Gateway hosted IndyCar, NHRA and NASCAR Nationwide and Truck events, Dover Motorsports closed the track in 2010. Real estate developer Curtis Francois subsequently acquired the facility, rechristened it Gateway Motorsports Park and inked agreements with the NHRA and NASCAR.</p> <p>Likened to Phoenix and Darlington, Gateway's asymmetrical oval has proven to be a demanding test of driver and machine, regardless of whether those machines are open wheel or stock cars. With Turns 1 and 2 tighter, but more steeply banked than Turns 3 and 4, the track requires a compromise chassis set-up, while the fact that the list of Gateway race winners includes names like Carl Edwards, Ron Hornaday and Juan Pablo Montoya attests to the demands it places on drivers.</p>",

Such was born one of the most unique short tracks in NASCAR history, a .625-mile oval that hosted the premier Cup Series twice a year until 1996.</p> <p>From the second that last checkered flag fell, race fans clamored for the return of North Wilkesboro. After a series of restoration efforts, the track was digitally restored to its 1987 state for iRacing in 2020, giving iRacers the opportunity to go back in time and relive the iconic North Carolina short track as it existed in its heyday. Such was the popularity of its virtual return that real-world NASCAR Cup Series racing returned in 2023 with the annual All-Star Race, and the track received numerous site upgrades, including a repave. Now, iRacers have the option of running both modern and vintage versions of the track.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "<p>It can fairly be said that American road racing entered the 21st century with the debut of the Circuit of the Americas as host of the 2012 United States Grand Prix. The first track in the United States designed specfically for Formula One, CoTA (as it is often called) was conceived by promoter Tavo Hellmund and Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz and designed with the assistance and noted race circuit designer Hermann Tilke.</p> <p>The ambitious CoTA project was revealed in July of 2010 when Hellmund announced plans to build the track on about 900 acres (3.7 km2) of undeveloped land near Austin, TX. With backing from billionaire Red McCombs, plans quickly proceeded. The circuit's design was submitted to the FIA for approval in December of 2010 with construction beginning later that month. The FIA issued its final approval of the circuit in September of 2012 some sixty days before the inaugural Formula One race.</p> <p>The 3.427-mile (5.515 km) Grand Prix circuit features CoTA's signature corner \u2013 Turn One, a tight hairpin at the crest of a 133 ft rise - followed by a rapid descent into a series of fast, sweeping corners leading to another hairpin. From there the cars follow a .62 mile straight (1.0 km) before a complex series of multi-apex corners in a stadium-like setting returns the cars to the pit straightaway. The facility also includes a shorter 2.6 mile (4.184 km) National circuit which, like the Grand Prix circuit, runs counter clockwise.</p> <p>In addition to the state-of-the-art circuit, pit and garage facilities, CoTA features impressive spectator and VIP amenities including a 251 feet (77 m) tall observation tower, several stadium grandstand seating sections and spectator mounds for general admission viewing. Along with Formula One, CoTA has hosted the V8 SuperCars Series, MotoGP, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the American Le Mans Series and the GRAND-AM Sports Car Series (now combined into the United SportsCar Championship) as well as various club and vintage events.</p>",

The lap begins with the complex Senna Chicane, which produces some of the most compelling photography in motorsport as Supercars can quite literally fly through the kerbing. Lengthy straightaways on the back half of the lap lead into the Dequetteville Hairpin, Victoria Park section, and finally the Mistral Hairpin that sets drivers up for a charge to the finish line.</p>",

But none of that would've been possible without the opening of Wheatland Raceway as a 3/8 mile dirt oval located in a former agricultural field in 2001. Three years later, Lucas Oil purchased the facility and rebuilt it, renovating both the track and its surrounding amenities to become one of the premier facilities in the country.</p> <p>Known as \"The Diamond of Race Tracks,\" the centerpiece clay-surface dirt oval remains unchanged in length from its original opening. With VIP luxury suites and a giant HD screen on site, fans attending races at Lucas Oil Speedway are treated to an on-site experience unlike most other dirt tracks in the nation. Hosting both national and weekly local events, only the best sprint car, late model, midget, and modified talent in the country is able to say they've taken the checkered flag in Wheatland.</p> <p>But that's not all. Wheatland's off-road complex has long been viewed as one of the premier layouts for short course racing in America, and it's easy to see why. Big jumps, challenging whoop sections, and even an over-under bridge make this one of the most memorable circuits most drivers will see. After an extended period of inactivity, the off-road track returned to the national calendar in 2025 as the season opener.</p>",
