The list of drivers who have advanced their careers behind the wheel of an SBF2000 reads like a Who's Who of motorsport, ranging from A.J. Almendinger to Mike Wallace, with Marco Andretti, Townsend Bell, Kenny Brack, Jeff Burton, Helio Castroneves, Jon Fogarty, Memo Gidley, Alex Gurney, Juan Pablo Montoya, Bryan Herta, Jeff Gordon, Todd Bodine and Kasey Kahne just a few of the names in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe SBF2000 features a 150-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. The 2.0-liter, single-overhead-cam power plant is mated to a five-speed sequential gearbox driving a 1,250-lb. tubular space-frame chassis. Capable of speeds up to 135 mph, the FSB 2000 accelerates from a standstill to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and through 100 mph in less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nOne of the most basic, but purest racing cars in existence, the SBF2000 offers drivers the chance both to learn the dynamics of an uncompromised racing car and how to compete with other drivers in identical equipment - lessons that are applicable in any car on any race track in the world.",

    "detail_copy": "Sporting a roof but no fenders, a Modified Stock Car \u2013 \u201cModified\u201d for short \u2013 is a unique oval-track race car. And while today\u2019s Modified is built from the ground up as a tube-frame chassied racecar and has significantly different configurations for paved or dirt tracks, the breed traces its lineage back to the very beginning of stock car racing. Light in weight and fitted with wider tires, a current Modified Stock Car is pure racer and much faster around a short oval paved track than one of NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup cars.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBack in the 1930s, stock car racers removed the windows and cut the fenders off their cars to reduce weight and hopped up the engines for extra power. As time went by racers began substituting running gear and then whole alternate chassis under their 1930\u2019s coupes and sedans, until finally there was really nothing \u201cstock\u201d about these Modified Stock Cars. Before the advent of \u201cStrictly Stock\u201d classes, NASCAR\u2019s early races in the late 1940s were all for Modifieds. And along the way, cars for pavement and dirt racing diverged in specification, with pavement cars getting lower and running wider tires and more left-side weight bias. By the 1980s the cars had become factory-built tube-frame race cars and the only stock components left were the bare engine block and the upper roof panel from a \u201970s or \u201980s subcompact such as the Ford Pinto and Chevy Cavalier.\r\n<br><br>\r\nToday, pavement Modifieds race mostly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states in two different configurations, known as NASCAR Whelen Tour Modifieds and SK Modifieds. For economic reasons, many local tracks run the SK Modified rules that originated at Connecticut\u2019s Stafford Springs Speedway. The SK Modified is similar to the Tour Modified in both minimum weight (2,600 pounds with the driver) and maximum 56% left-side weight bias. In the interest of cost savings, however, the SK Modified is equipped with a low-compression 358 cubic-in V8 engine with wet-sump lubrication system and a two-barrel Holley carb producing around 385 horsepower.",

So it should be no surprise that the Pro Mazda Series has produced a host of young Pro racers, from Indy car racers Marco Andretti and Graham Rahal to Formula One vet Scott Speed, Grand Am Daytona Prototype Pro Colin Braun and NASCAR Sprint Cup racer (and former Pro Mazda series champ) Michael McDowell.\n<br><br>\nThe series, begun in 1991, originally featured a tube-frame car with a less powerful version of Mazda's rotary powerplant.  The 2004 introduction of the current-generation car helped take the series to the next level.  Sanctioned today by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), the Pro Mazda Series runs on professional race weekends with the American Le Mans Series and Grand Am Rolex Sports Car Series, and sometimes as the feature event on its own weekends.\n<br><br>\nWith a dry weight of 1,140 pounds (as raced minimum weight including driver and fluids of 1,320 pounds) and a power-to-weight ratio of 1:5, a Pro Mazda will accelerate from zero to 60 in less than three seconds, and attain a top speed of 150+ mph.  Because the Pro Mazda Series is a spec series, budgets are within reason (and each year's winner of the Skip Barber National Series receives a $300,000 scholarship from Mazda for the following Pro Mazda season.)

The Company has evolved to become the UK's largest producer of race and track cars, selling over 2,700 cars globally in past two decades. To sell that many racing cars the package has to be thrilling, dramatic and huge fun to drive. Radical Motorsport is represented by a 33-strong dealer network spanning 21 countries offering customers a complete racing experience in 12 different single-marque championships around the globe. Radical Motorsport's championships comprise the world's most iconic racetracks, and customers have the opportunity to join other international Radical championships in the 'Race the World' programme.</p> <p>Near the top of the Radical range is the SR8, which claimed the overall lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring's legendary 13-mile, 73-turn Nordschleife in 2005, which remained unbeaten for 12 years. With 380 horsepower and 1,320 pounds (dry; all-up weight including driver and all fluids of 1,750 pounds) the performance of this nimble two-seater is little short of stunning. The engine is an engineering masterpiece: hand built, race specification 2.6 litre V8 boasts a rev limit of 10,500 rpm delivering relentless acceleration. A pair of twin-cam, four-valve cylinder heads and blocks are installed at a 72-degree angle on a purpose-built billet crankshaft and custom-cast light alloy dry-sump crankcase. Appropriate accessories are added and the result is a very compact, lightweight, engine. The output from this powerful engine is transmitted through an AP racing clutch to a six-speed Powertec sequential transaxle with torque-biased limited slip.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "The United States Auto Club's Silver Crown car, which traces its lineage back to the very first open-wheel cars that raced on county-fair horse tracks a century ago.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the 1960s, Indycar design went to low-slung, mid-engine cars derived from Formula One technology of that time, so in 1971 USAC designated a separate championship, dubbed Silver Crown today, for the descendants of the classic upright, front-engine, tube-frame beasts that had dominated Indycar competition for decades. As more major races were held on 1.5-mile and larger superspeedways, USAC developed a new set of technical specifications for Silver Crown cars that reflected the safety, aerodynamic and other requirements for a car capable of 170+ mph laps around big racetracks.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNew-look cars were constructed by several manufacturers, including BEAST, Riley and DRC. The iRacing model is by Indianapolis-based C&R and was designed by C&R owner Chris Paulsen and former Lola and Reynard Indycar designer Bruce Ashmore. There's no question but that the new-look Silver Crown car is the fastest front-engine, open-wheel, oval-track racer in history. It is also an excellent training tool for oval-track drivers, both those with open-wheel aspirations and those aiming for a stockcar career, as they transition from short tracks to superspeedway racing. \r\n<br><br>\r\nSo, if it's an oval-track driving challenge you're looking for, this car will provide that and more. With 819 methanol-fueled horsepower at the rear wheels of a car that weighs 1,650 pounds, excess acceleration is always available.  A driver who can wheel this car around quickly and not put it in the fence is skilled indeed.",

At 53.5 inches at the top of the windshield, the new Impala is several inches taller than its Monte Carlo predecessor, reflecting a desire to use additional aerodynamic drag to slow speeds at 2.5-mile and longer tracks, such as Daytona International Speedway and its fractionally longer sister track, Talladega Superspeedway.\n<br><br>\nAll of the mechanical adjustments permitted in the rules and possible on the physical version of the car are possible on its virtual counterpart.  It's a complicated car to set up and on a fast track a challenging one to race, but experienced simracers will achieve a high level of satisfaction in competing on America's top stock car tracks with the Chevrolet Impala, and every iRacer can test with the car to sample what was previously off limits to all but the top-level pros.",

    "detail_copy": "The notion of competing in a class of identical race cars so that driving skill is paramount and the size of one's checkbook doesn't matter is second nature to iRacers - it's a central theme of the iRacing.com community. But the concept, originally borrowed from one-design sailboat racing, is rapidly gaining currency in motorsport with classes ranging from Spec Miata to Star Mazda and even to IndyCar, where every team races the same chassis/engine combination.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe original successful one-design auto racing class, first introduced a quarter-century ago in Sports Car Club of America amateur racing and still going strong today (after a few universally-applied modifications along the way), is Spec Racer Ford. Manufactured and marketed by SCCA Enterprises (a subsidiary of SCCA, Inc.) the Spec Racer Ford is a purpose-built sports/racing car. With more than 850 cars manufactured, it is one of the most prolific dedicated racing cars in the world, and has served as the launching pad for a number of drivers who have gone on to substantial success in motorsport, including racer-turned-broadcaster Dorsey Schroeder. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe car was developed and originally manufactured by Renault/Jeep Sport USA. An initial proof-of-concept was assembled using the longitudinal engine-transmission package from the Renault LeCar, but that vehicle was written off in testing at Road Atlanta and a more practical successor was then developed using the transverse Renault/AMC four-cylinder Encore powertrain. Known as the Sports Renault, that vehicle, which looks virtually identical to today's SRF, made its debut in SCCA club racing in 1984. The car was sold to competitors in kit form, but to facilitate technical support and give buyers a turn-key option, SCCA established a regional network of sales and service dealers, a concept that under the name Customer Service Representatives, remains a key element in the success of the class today. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith AMC sold off to Chrysler and Renault sponsorship withdrawn in 1989 after a fleet of hundreds of cars had been put into service, the class was renamed Spec Racer and the club took over responsibility for manufacturing and supporting the car. Five years later, with the original Renault engines and transmissions growing scarce, SCCA began a program to gradually shift the fleet to a 1.9-liter four-cylinder Ford engine and five-speed transmission, and for several years the club supported two classes racing alongside one another, the original SR and for newly manufactured cars and ones that had been converted, SRF with 105 horsepower (10 more than the Renault) and a top speed of 135 mph.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFurther demonstrating its commitment to the class, SCCA introduced the Spec Racer Ford Gen3 formula in 2015. A new 1.6-liter engine fitted to the existing engine mounts boosts the car by an additional 30 horsepower, while also lightening the car by more than 100 pounds. The result is an even more fun and agile car to drive for an affordable price, with a higher top speed of 150 miles per hour as the cherry on top. This version of the car makes its debut in iRacing for 2021 Season 3.\r\n",

Among the most graceful race cars ever built, the Lotus 79 also ranks among the most successful, carrying Mario Andretti and Ronnie Peterson to six wins en route to both the 1978 Constructors Championship (for Lotus) and the World Drivers Championship (for Andretti). Beyond its race wins and championship, however, the Lotus 79's ground effect design distinguishes it as one of history's most influential race cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lotus 79 was the logical successor to the Lotus 78, a revolutionary race car in its own right. Although aerodynamics had played an increasing role in race car design since the advent of wings in the late '60s, the Lotus 78 was the first to apply the Bernoulli Principle (which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid - in this case, air -- occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure) to the entire chassis. Just as \"lift\" is created by accelerating the speed of air flowing over an airplane's wings, so Chapman & Co. generated \"downforce\" by accelerating the speed of air flowing under their race car's venturi-shaped sidepods . . . and employing sliding, spring-loaded skirts to \"seal\" that airflow under the sidepods. The resulting downforce effectively pinned the Lotus 78 to the ground (hence the term \"ground effect\"), while generating a fraction of the drag created by the large wings that had become ubiquitous on F1 cars. Although the Lotus 78 still employed wings, they were used to fine-tune the car's balance rather than as the primary source of downforce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lotus 78 was a highly effective race car, winning five times in the hands of Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson in 1977. However, the location of the 78's rear suspension disturbed the airflow exiting the sidepods, while the design of the sidepods themselves was imperfect, creating a center of pressure so far forward that a large rear wing was necessary to balance the downforce. The Lotus 79 addressed these shortcomings. Thanks to what would now be deemed crude wind tunnel work, the sidepods were redesigned to create a more even application of downforce. They were also extended back to a rear suspension which had been reworked to provide a clean exit for the air flowing through the sidepods. This, in turn, enabled the Lotus 79 to utilize a smaller rear wing than its predecessor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform for all this aerodynamic alchemy was a monocoque chassis constructed of sheet aluminum (rather than the 78's honeycomb aluminum) in the interests of minimizing weight and keeping the cockpit narrow, thus enabling the sidepods to be as broad as possible in order to generate maximum downforce. Originally designed for a compact Lotus-Getrag gearbox, the 79 eventually utilized a five speed Hewland FG400 mated to the celebrated Ford-Cosworth DFV engine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was as fast as it was beautiful. After an abortive debut in a non-championship race at Silverstone, Andretti practiced the 79 at Monaco but opted to drive his trusty 78 in the race. By the Belgian Grand Prix in June, the Lotus 79 was ready to race and it proved unbeatable, at least in terms of speed. Andretti and Peterson won six of eight races in mid-season, scoring one-twos at Zolder, Jarama, Paul Ricard and Zandvoort. The Lotus failed to win only the Swedish Grand Prix (where Andretti experienced engine trouble and Peterson was delayed by a punctured tire) and the British GP (where the American suffered a blown engine and the Swede's fuel pump failed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andretti won the World Championship handily, clinching the title at the Italian Grand Prix with the U.S. and Canadian Grands Prix still to be run. Sadly, of course, Peterson lost his life due to complications from injuries he suffered in a start-line crash at Monza, having been forced to switch to a spare Lotus 78 after crashing his 79 in practice owing to a brake failure.</p>",

    "detail_copy": "Today the name Corvette signifies performance on the street and the race track, but America's first true sports car had a checkered racing history in its early years.  In part because of Chevrolet's avowed non-participation in motor sports following the 1955 Le Mans disaster, the terms Corvette and racing were usually synonymous with privateers like Dr. Dick Thompson, Don Yenko and John Greenwood.\r\nThat began to change in the 1980s with the Corvette GTP car (designed in partnership with Lola) and reached full flower at the dawn of the 21st century when Chevrolet teamed with Pratt and Miller Engineering to design, develop and race a competition version of the Corvette C5 at the highest levels of international sports car racing.  After some initial teething pains, the C5.R won the GT class at both 24 Hours of Daytona and Le Mans in 2001 and went on to add three straight wins at Sebring, two more wins at Le Mans and, along with three consecutive American Le Mans Series GT1 titles.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBy 2005 the new and improved Corvette C6 was ready for market, and the C6.R soon followed.  Like its predecessor, it utilized a 427 cubic inch V8 developed by Katech Engine Developments.  Featuring a dry sump, CNC ported cylinder heads, titanium valves and connecting rods and a steel forged crankshaft, the LS7R engine was officially good for 590 BHP and 640 pound feet of torque.  The C6.R was a logical development of its forerunner, albeit with a single air intake, flush headlamps and a reconfigured profile - particularly the roofline.  Coupled with an improved rear diffuser, a more efficient rear wing and a revised front bumper, the CR.6 generated the same amount of downforce as the CR.5 but with 6% less drag. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n \r\nThe C6.R took up where its predecessor left off, winning Corvette\u00bfs fifth straight ALMS GT1 title and, despite fierce opposition from the ProDrive Aston Martins, a third class win at Le Mans.  Corvette went on to dominate GT1 competition in the United States and Europe, earning four ALMS titles and a total of six class wins at Le Mans and Sebring, before General Motors announced the GT1 CR.6 would be retired midway through the 2009 season in order to enter GT2 competition.  The CR.6 went out with guns blazing, winning at Sebring and Long Beach before earning a final victory at Le Mans to cap one of the most dominating runs in the annals of sports car racing.",

A graduate of Polytechnic Milan, Dallara had pursued a career in race car design with Ferrari and Maserati before joining Lamborghini where he designed the Espada and the legendary Miura.  Dallara later worked for De Tomaso, designing Formula 2 cars and Frank Williams' first Formula One car as well as contributing to the design of the Pantera.\r\nAfter forming Dallara Automobili, Dallara produced a series of small-engined prototypes before successfully moving into the open wheel market with a Formula 3 car that won the Italian championship in 1980.  Subsequently, Dallara became one of the world's leading manufacturers of open wheel race cars and now dominates the Formula 3 market and supplies cars for the GP2 series as well as the World Series by Renault.  In addition, Dallara has consulted on the design, research and production of racing projects for Audi, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Honda and Toyota.\r\nIn 1997, Dallara entered the Indy car market with its IR7.  That basic design, updated in '98 (IR8) and '99 (IR9), won two IndyCar Series (ICS) titles and a like number of Indy 500s.  A second generation chassis was introduced in 2000 and it too achieved considerable success, winning three straight Indianapolis 500s and two IndyCar Series titles. In 2005 Dallara introduced a host of aerodynamic updates to the chassis (designated the IR05), which has continued as the platform for subsequent Indy cars.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe IR03/05 incorporates a host of safety enhancements including energy-absorbing materials in the footbox and leg areas as well as a 7 mm thick side anti- intrusion panel and a compact, gears-forward transmission.  Additionally, the mounting points for the Suspension and Wheel Energy Management System (SWEMS) \"tethering\" the wheels to the car are fully-integrated into the Dallara's design. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the basic chassis, Dallara also supplies an array of front and rear wings designed to optimize performance on a variety of race tracks including road courses, street circuits and short ovals, 1.5 mile speedways and the 2.5 mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSince its introduction, the Dallara 03/05 has won six of seven Indianapolis 500s and the five most recent ICS titles.  Although ICS regulations do not preclude teams from utilizing other approved chassis, the Dallara is now used by every team in the IndyCar Series.",

And while today\u2019s Modified is built from the ground up as a tube-frame chassis racecar and has significantly different configurations for paved or dirt tracks, the breed traces its lineage back to the very beginning of stock car racing. Light in weight and fitted with wider tires, a current Modified Stock Car is pure racer and much faster around a short oval paved track than one of NASCAR\u2019s Sprint Cup cars.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBack in the 1930s, stock car racers removed the windows and cut the fenders off their cars to reduce weight and hopped up the engines for extra power. As time went by racers began substituting running gear and then whole alternate chassis under their 1930\u2019s coupes and sedans, until finally there was really nothing \u201cstock\u201d about these Modified Stock Cars. Before the advent of \u201cStrictly Stock\u201d classes, NASCAR\u2019s early races in the late 1940s were all for Modifieds. And along the way, cars for pavement and dirt racing diverged in specification, with pavement cars getting lower and running wider tires and more left-side weight bias. By the 1980s the cars had become factory-built tube-frame race cars and the only stock components left were the bare engine block and the upper roof panel from a \u201970s or \u201980s subcompact such as the Ford Pinto and Chevy Cavalier.\r\n<br><br>\r\nToday, pavement Modifieds race mostly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states in two different configurations, known as NASCAR Whelen Tour Modifieds and SK Modifieds.

    "detail_copy": "Nothing better epitomizes American grassroots racing than the sprint car.  Its iconic roller skate shape hearkens back to a time when the likes of Bill Vukovich, Jimmy Bryan and Parnelli Jones scratched and clawed their ways from the short tracks of America to a front-row seat in the Indianapolis 500.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nA sprint car feature win at Terre Haute is no longer an E-ticket to the Indy 500, but sprint cars have continued to play a vital role both as a stepping stone for drivers like Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart and Kasey Kahne and as the top of the short-track pyramid in parts of the United States as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.  Small wonder.  With a compact wheelbase and a power-to-weight ratio approaching that of a modern Formula One car, muscling a sprint car around a bullring for 20 or 30 laps is not for the faint of heart.\r\n<br><br>\r\nApart from a similar power-to-weight ratio, sprint cars are a long way removed from their Formula One counterparts.  Lacking a clutch, flywheel and transmission, they utilize a direct drive system engaged from the cockpit.  With no onboard starters or even a battery, sprint cars rely on a push start (usually by a push truck) and are powered by a 410 cubic inch, push rod engine.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBrutish?  You bet.  But sprint cars also demand a certain finesse from their mechanics and drivers.  Consider that no two of a sprint car's tires are alike.  In fact, all four are not only different sizes but different rubber compounds.  Also remember that, while a sprint car feature rarely lasts more than 25 miles, with 800+ horsepower and 650 lb/ft of torque on tap it takes a delicate touch with the steering wheel, and the throttle, to make that right-rear tire go the distance.",

    "detail_copy": "<b>Ford GT-R</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Ford GT-R is the 21st century version of one of the most recognizable and successful sports cars in history - the Ford GT40.  Designed and constructed at the direction of Henry Ford II following Ford's failed bid to purchase Ferrari in the early 1960s, the Ford GT40 debuted at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1964.  After a couple of heartbraking defeats at Le Mans, the Ford GT40 scored a dramatic victory there in 1966, the first of four consecutive wins for Ford at the French classic.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNearly forty years after its success at Le Mans, the Ford Motor Company reprised the iconic Ford GT40 shape with a modern version of the Ford GT which sold in limited quantities in 2005 and 2006.   Noted race car constructor Kevin Doran used the car as the basis for a new generation of racing Ford GTs - dubbed the Ford GT Mk VII -- which were campaigned in American Le Mans Series competition by Black Swan and Robertson Racing beginning in 2008. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith its potent five liter V8 mounted amidship, six speed, semi-automatic gearbox and updated aerodynamics, the Ford GT Mk VII was a welcome and potentially competitive addition to the ALMS GT-2 competition.  In the hands of privateer teams like Black Swan and Robertson Racing, however, the Ford usually played the role of David to the Goliaths of the factory BMWs, Corvettes, Ferraris and Porsches.\r\nRobertson Racing subsequently assumed the lead role developing and campaigning the car, rechristened the Ford GT-R.  The team experienced mixed fortunes in ALMS competition before drivers/owners David and Andrea Robertson (together with teammate David Murry) scored an enormously popular podium finish in the GTE-Am class in their debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2011.",

Its technical significance stems from the fact that, when it was introduced in 1967, the Lotus 49 was the first successful Formula One car to feature the engine as a fully-stressed, structural component of the chassis. And what an engine! Colin Chapman and Maurice Philippe designed the Lotus 49 around the new Ford-Cosworth DFV which would go on to become one of the winningest engine designs in the history of motorsports. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBut racing fans have an emotional attachment to the Lotus 49 that goes deeper than their appreciation for its revolutionary chassis design and prolific engine. In the car's debut, Lotus teammates Jim Clark and Graham Hill dominated the 1967 Grand Prix of the Netherlands with Hill winning the pole and Clark taking the race victory. Clark would go on to three more victories in the Lotus 49 that season, the final wins of his tragically shortened career, while Hill captured his second World Championship in a Lotus 49B the following season.\r\n",

The mid-mounted 5.5-liter, naturally aspirated V-8 develops approximately 600 bhp which is transmitted to the final drive via a six-speed sequential gearbox.  The Corvette features a chrome moly chassis equipped with a double-wishbone suspension, including push-rod-actuated coil springs over dampers.  Add it all up and the result is a Corvette C7 that is a regular visitor to victory lane in IMSA Tudor United SportsCar Championship competition.\n",

Power produced \"conventionally\" by the turbocharged, direct injection 1.6 liter, V6 engine is augmented by the F1 Energy Recovery System (ERS) which harvests thermal energy from the turbo and braking systems, and delivers additional thrust through the Motor Generator Unit. No less innovative is the MP4-30's chassis which features an exaggerated \"Coke\" bottle shape around the engine and transmission, aiding airflow to the diffuser, wings and other downforce-generating devices at the back of the car which, as with all current F1 cars, utilizes the Drag Reduction System when closely following another car in order to create additional overtaking opportunities.\n<br><br>\nThanks to the unprecedented access to McLaren's CAD files and data, iRacing's digital McLaren MP4-30 incorporates current Formula One technology at a level never before seen in sim racing.  As a result, iRacing redesigned its engine model to incorporate the ERS and MGU as well as the accompanying energy \"storage\" and \"depletion\".  As well, implementing the DRS necessitated the creation of overtaking zones based on a competitor's proximity to the car ahead.\n<br><br>\nIn short, iRacing's McLaren MP4-30 is the most sophisticated digital race car yet created and represents an exciting new frontier for sim racing. \n",

As the IMSA GTO regulations were more conducive to cutting-edge technology, Audi developed a full-fledged race car from scratch.  The resulting Audi 90 GTO featured a steel, tubular space-frame, double wishbone suspension with coil springs, ventilated discs brakes all 'round and, of course, Audi's signature Quattro all-wheel drive system.  Power was supplied by a five cylinder, 2190 ccm engine equipped with a KKK turbocharger.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith Hurley Haywood and Hans Stuck at the wheel (joined by Scott Goodyear and World Rally Champion Walter R\u00f6hrl on long distance events) the Audi 90 dominated the IMSA GTO competition . . . once it got going.  After skipping the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring and failing to finish in their debut at the Miami street race, the Audi was nearly unbeatable as Stuck won seven times in the remaining nine races (teaming with Rohrl at Watkins Glen) with Haywood providing no fewer than five one-two finishes (with Goodyear on board at Watkins Glen).  However, given the fact that the opposition effectively enjoyed a three race head start, Stuck and Audi finished second in the drivers and manufacturers point standings to Pete Halsmer and the Mercury Cougar XR7.  Subsequently, Audi turned its attention to the German Production Car championship (forerunner to today's German Touring Car championship or DTM), winning the 1990 and '91 manufacturers championships with Stuck and Frank Biela taking the drivers titles. \r\n",

Along with the Jaguar ( XJR9 and 10), the Porsche 956/962 ruled the sports prototype roost in the mid-to-late 1980s, most especially the IMSA Camel GT Series.  But beginning with a win at Miami street race in '87, progressing to Geoff Brabham's IMSA Camel GT drivers title in '88 and culminating in an '89 season that saw Brabham narrowly edge teammate Chip Robinson for a second drivers title while capturing the manufacturers championship, the Nissan GTP ZX-T emerged as the dominant force in North American sports car racing.\n<br><br>\nAfter utilizing a Lola-810 chassis for the basis of Nissan's first IMSA challenger in 1985, Electramotive Engineering gradually segued into building its own chassis to house Nissan's prodigiously powerful VG30ET turbocharged engine.  Always fast, the Nissans were fragile, at least initially. But by '88 continuous development largely cured the reliability problems and, but for the fact the Electramotive team skipped the opening rounds of the IMSA schedule (the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring) Nissan would have almost certainly won the manufacturers title to go along with Brabham's drivers championship. The following year Electramotive made no such mistakes, and after a problematic Daytona, came through to win at Miami and Sebring, the latter with Arie Luyendyk joining Brabham and Robinson at the wheel.   With additional wins at Road Atlanta, Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio, Watkins Glen, Road America, Heartland Motorsports Park (Topeka), the San Antonio street race and Sears Point, the Nissan GTP ZX-T solidified its reputation as one of the most potent sports cars of any era.\n",

But underneath the fiberglass coachwork lives a thoroughly modern, high-tech, fully-adjustable tube-frame race car.  \n<br><br>\nHigh technology and low cost don't often go together in motorsport, but while the Legend Car features completely adjustable suspension for chassis tuning, a reliable, low-maintenance 1250 cc Yamaha motorcycle engine and transmission makes the purchase price and operating costs of the Legends Car relatively affordable. And while the box-stock Yamaha makes just 122 horsepower, the all-up weight including driver of 1,300 pounds means that the diminutive racer has decidedly non-diminutive performance. \n<br><br>\nSince 1992 when legendary promoter H.A. \"Humpy\" Wheeler and driver Elliott Forbes-Robinson rolled the first Legend Car onto the pavement at Charlotte Motor Speedway, thousands of the diminutive racing cars have been turned loose on ovals (paved and dirt) and road circuits across America, Europe and Asia.\n",

The car evolved over time to incorporate hybrid technology in the form of KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System).\r\n<br><br>\r\nAs indicated in the cars name (Quattro) the R18 features a 4-wheel drive system - the front wheels are powered by an electric motor while the rear wheels receive power from the diesel engine. This is a unique setup that automatically provides power to the optimal wheel as the car accelerates - functioning almost like a traction control system - making the car easier to drive, especially in long endurance races where the track conditions can change.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe R18, in its varied forms, won the Le Mans 24 Hour four times and the WEC title twice (2012 & 2013).",

The Corolla immediately impressed by taking the first five race victories of its debut season, while Ricardo Zonta came within just a handful of points of giving it a championship on its first try. The Corolla driver lineup got even stronger in 2021 with the addition of IndyCar legend Tony Kanaan.",

Shod in silver in a return to the German manufacturer's traditional racing colors, the car also represented a drastic change from its predecessor, the W12, due to major changes in regulations from the 2021 season. Its most striking visual changes include much smaller sidepods than previous seasons, which were introduced in preseason testing and used throughout the year. </p><p>\nWhile not as dominant as the W12, the W13 still debuted on the podium in Bahrain with driver Lewis Hamilton, and teammate George Russell scored his first podium in the car two rounds later in Australia. The car began to truly find its footing after major upgrades in Spain, with at least one podium finish in seven of the next eight races. After back-to-back runner-up finishes for Hamilton in the United States and Mexico, the team capped off the season with a 1-2 finish in the penultimate round in Brazil, with Russell scoring his first career Grand Prix victory. In total, the W13 produced 17 podiums and six fastest laps across 22 events. </p>",

The concept married elements of past all-star racing series with senior tour golf and weekly short track racing: six straight weeks of action in the summer on a mix of paved and dirt ovals, featuring an eclectic mix of racing champions, rising young stars, and even some local heroes who earned their way onto the grid for one shot at glory with the pros.</p> <p>Designed from the ground up by Evernham and built by Fury Race Cars, the SRX car is a stock car unlike any other. Equipped with 700 horsepower Ilmor V8s and a high spoiler straight out of the 1970s, these cars were built for lots of power and low downforce, making them a challenge to drive. Like in the real world, iRacing's SRX car is equipped with both paved and dirt tires so you can race it on whichever ovals you'd like!</p>",
